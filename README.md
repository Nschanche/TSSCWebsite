## Makefile tasks

The Makefile provides the following useful commands:
* `make html` to compile *all pages* and store them under `output/`.
* `make quick` to compile *only pages that have changed*.  This is faster than `make html` but will cause the front and news pages to be incomplete.
* `make devserver` to start a development webserver on your local machine at `http://localhost:8000`, which will auto-compile a page when you make a change. This too causes the frontpage to be empty unless you call `make html`.
* `make github` to send the compiled HTML files to the [development server](http://tessgi.github.io/TessGiWebsite/).

Note: `make quick` and `make devserver` both use agressive caching which allows the website to be built quickly, but causes the listing of news items to be missing from the front page (`output/index.html`).  You need to call `make html` if you care about a preview of the front page. Calling `make github` or `make live` automatically triggers `make html`.
