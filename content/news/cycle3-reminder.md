The [TESS Cycle 3 proposal call](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary!init.do?solId={21B53A82-2F78-9C26-3CA6-B9FEFE2AF929}&path=open)
was released in
October. Proposals are due on January 16, 2020 at 4.30pm EST.

We encourage those interested in submitting a proposal to carefully
read the
[Call for Proposals](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary!init.do?solId={21B53A82-2F78-9C26-3CA6-B9FEFE2AF929}&path=open)
and the information available on our website regarding [proposing investigations](proposing.html).

We remind proposers that in Cycle 3, two new observing modes will potentially be available and collected: 10-minute cadence full-frame images and 20-second cadence postage stamps at "shared risk". Modifications to the observing plan are possible following testing and evaluation by the project. A 2-minute cadence mode will also be available as in previous cycles. 

There is also a new Key Project proposal category, and ground-based observing focused programs are also solicited. We also emphasize that in the extended mission, all postage stamp targets will be
selected via this Guest Investigator Program or via the [Director's
Discretionary Targets Program](ddt.html).

TESS Cycle 3 observations will be collected during the first year of the extended mission,
running from July 2020 until June 2021. All Cycle 3 fields are in the
Southern Ecliptic Hemisphere. The
[Web TESS Viewing Tool](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/wsgi-scripts/TESS/TESS-point_Web_Tool/TESS-point_Web_Tool/wtv_v2.0.py/)
has been updated to include the Cycle 3 pointings, so that proposers
can determine when a target is expected to be observed by TESS.

Proposers may also be interested in the templates we have created to
assist in putting together a proposal. [The templates can be found on
our website.](proposing.html)

Proposers requesting short-cadence target slots (either 20-second or
2-minute cadence) need to submit a target list along with the
proposal. Information on [how to create a target table](proposing.html) can be found on our website. MAST has also created a [tutorial](https://archive.stsci.edu/tess/tutorials/goddard_format.html) to create an appropriate list.

Any questions regarding proposing to the TESS Cycle 3 call should be
addressed to [tesshelp@bigbang.gsfc.nasa.gov](tesshelp@bigbang.gsfc.nasa.gov).
