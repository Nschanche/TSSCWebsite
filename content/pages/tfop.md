Title: TESS Follow-up Program
template: slide
save_as: tfop.html


<p>The TESS Follow-Up Observing Program (TFOP) is a large international working group of astronomers brought together to primarily provide follow-up observations to support the TESS Mission's primary goal of measuring the masses for 50 planets smaller than 4 Earth radii. Stars hosting high priority planet candidates are observed to establish reliable stellar parameters, confirm the existence of planets, refine their radii, and measure planet masses.</p>
<p>The TFOP is led by the <a href = "https://www.cfa.harvard.edu"> Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO)</a>, in coordination with MIT, as part of the TESS Science Office. A goal of TFOP is to foster communication and coordination among the TESS Science Team members and the community in order to maximize scientific output and minimize duplication of effort. </p>
<p>The TFOP is organized into five sub-groups: </p>
  - Seeing-Limited Photometry (SG1)
  - Recon Spectroscopy (SG2)
  - High-Resolution Imaging (SG3)
  - Precise Radial Velocities (SG4)
  - Space-Based Photometry (SG5)
<p>TFOP observations are performed with committed time on the [Las Cumbres Observatory Network](https://lco.global) (for photometry and spectroscopy), the MEarth (photometry) and TRES (spectroscopy) facilities, and numerous other facilities through the usual telescope time allocation processes. </p>
<p>There are currently dozens of working groups (each representing a team and facility from around the world) involved in TFOP and additional participation and follow-up programs are welcome. For more information and to apply to join TFOP, [check out the MIT website here](https://tess.mit.edu/followup/).
Observations acquired via the TFOP are uploaded to the ExoFOP Repository, described in further detail below.</p>


### ExoFOP Repository
<p>ExoFOP is a web-based service developed and operated by the <a href = 'http://nexsci.caltech.edu'> NASA Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI) </a> originally for the Kepler and K2 Follow-Up Observation Programs. ExoFOP plays a key role in coordinating TESS Follow-Up Observing Program (TFOP) activities and hosting observations and tools. ExoFOP is a 'sand-box' for the community to share data and information regarding follow-up observations to help facilitate the efficient and effective use of community telescope resources. ExoFOP is connected to and integrated with the <a href = 'https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu'> NASA Exoplanet Archive </a>.</p>
<p>ExoFOP hosts a dedicated page for TESS, <a href = 'https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/tess/'> ExoFOP-TESS </a>, with a format similar to the Kepler/K2 pages. ExoFOP-TESS contains overview pages for everything in TIC V8 (~1.7 billion targets).
<ul>ExoFOP-TESS includes:</p>
  <li>Summaries of TESS-observed targets</li>
  <li>TOI/CTOI lists with candidate planet parameters</li>
  <li>Overviews of individual targets</li>
  <li>Summaries of observations</li>
  <li>Observing notes</li>
  <li>Links to outside services (NASA Exoplanet Archive tools, MAST data and documentation, Simbad and other host star resources, community-produced light curves and products, and more)</li>
  <li>Telescope resource calendar</li>
</ul> 
<p>All files (data/image/notes) can be uploaded in any format, in single or bulk-uploads. Attached notes can be html to enable linking within ExoFOP or outside. ExoFOP-TESS products will be searchable and available to sort and download. A tool to follow specific targets, or sets of targets, can be enabled via a "My Targets" feature with an option for email updates.</p>
