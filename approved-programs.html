                        <div class="accordion-body">We propose to investigate the evolution of helium in the local solar neighborhood, in particular the (Delta Y/Delta Z) relation, using asteroseismic data of stars in the TESS Continuous Viewing Zone (CVZ). The helium abundance is one of the most poorly constrained inputs needed to construct stellar models, but it strongly affects a star's structure and subsequent evolution. Helium cannot be detected in the photosphere of most stars. Asteroseismology allows us to determine the helium abundance in the outer convection-zone of stars indirectly by modelling stellar oscillation frequencies, and directly by looking at the acoustic glitch signal of helium ionization. Stars in the TESS CVZ will allow us to study the (Delta Y/Delta Z) relation. Our target list has 188 stars in the southern CVZ.

For five blazars near the south ecliptic pole, we will measure the incidence of flares and the fraction of time spent in high and low states for a full year. Our targets are gamma-ray blazars or candidate gamma-ray blazars pointed within 5 degrees to our line of sight; their emission is almost purely from the jets. The TESS time resolution will separate out individual flares and track fractal-variable emission on timescales accessible for the first time for a large number of blazars.

Specifically, we propose to look for the periodic magnification of the MS star caused by gravitational lensing by the BH or NS companion, which leads to an increase in flux on the order of 100--1000 ppm, lasting a few hours. Thus TESS is the ideal instrument for this search technique. We estimate that TESS will be able to detect and measure the masses of ~20 BHs and ~50 NSs with better than ~10% accuracy. Mass lower limits will be measured for over 200 systems, increasing the known population of galactic black holes by an order of magnitude.

We will search the light curves for transiting planets, expecting to triple the number of transiting planets known in clusters, which will shed light on the timescales for processes in planet formation, evolution, and migration. The public data set will also be a gold mine for stellar astrophysics, including studies of gyrochronology, variability and tests of stellar evolution.

We need a larger sample of transiting WJs to test theories for their origins. However, the TESS core program will only discover a handful due to long orbital periods and low occurrence rates. Also, future SC and ground-based observations can yield valuable constraints on WJ properties, but prioritization based on observability and scientific value is needed to choose the best targets. We propose to discover and catalog WJs in full frame images; fit light curves of WJs discovered by our program and others; and produce a prioritized list of continuous viewing zone WJs as future SC targets and a prioritized catalog of WJs for ground-based follow-up.

Our proposed photometry will also enable asteroseismology of dozens of known and high-likelihood pulsating white dwarfs, continuing the space-based revolution into the interiors of stellar remnants. From both asteroseismology and spot modulation of magnetic white dwarfs we will significant expand the number of white dwarfs with measured rotation rates, putting strong constraints on the endpoints of angular momentum in stars.

Ground-based photometry of the 2.7 Myr old star CVSO 30 revealed transit-like dips in flux with a short period of only 0.45 d. While strongly reminiscent of planetary transits, the observed flux dips change in shape and occasionally even appear to vanish. This challenges an interpretation in terms of a planet. Existing ground-based light curves mostly focus on the transit ephemeris and suffer from the usual limitations. A thorough study of the transits and variability in a system with a young and extremely active star like CVSO 30 requires continuous observations, which can only be provided by space-based instrumentation

Subgiant stars are especially valuable because we can also measure their surface rotation, which is difficult or impossible for more evolved stars. Prior studies have given us strong evidence for cores rotating faster than their surfaces, but only for small subgiant samples. We request observations of 50 high-priority subgiant stars in the southern continuous viewing zone. A one year time series will yield high quality data capable of measuring internal rotation, and we have arranged complementary ground-based data to fully characterize these important targets. This powerful sample will permit tests of gyrochronlogy and stellar angular momentum evolution theory, and it has other broad applications.

This study will fundamentally probe the nature of the atmospheric, structural, and rotational changes at the end of the stellar main sequence, and how these physical processes manifest as broadband variability through magnetic activity and weather.

So far, naked-eye stars (V<6) have been rarely observed with high-precision photometry from space due to the large number of pixels required to capture saturated pixel columns. Here we propose adapt a low-pixel-cost technique, which our team pioneered for the K2 Mission, to produce high-precision 2-minute cadence light curves of all naked eye stars observable by TESS. The software tools and data products will enable numerous science applications, including tests of asteroseismic scaling relations for red giants, the detection of transiting planets orbiting naked-eye stars, pulsations in massive stars, and studies of interacting binaries.

However, light curves from FFIs will not be a standard TESS data product, and hence the success of science from FFIs relies on efforts by the community. Here we propose to develop and run a complete, end-to-end photometry pipeline for TESS FFI data, producing analysis-ready light curves for all FFI sources. Using powerful computing resources and software developed through community workshops within the TESS Asteroseismic Science Consortium, the light curves produced in this program will enable a vast array of science investigations across stellar astrophysics and exoplanet science.

All of our targets have previously been observed using high precision photometry from space with the WIRE satellite, and the combination of TESS+WIRE data of these stars will provide long timebase datasets inaccessible in any other way for this sample of stars. We will perform forward seismic modeling and compare results to our measured oscillation frequencies, constraining our models with known spectroscopic parameters. In addition, we will be able to observe stellar evolution occurring in real time with some of our targets.

As stars contract on the pre-main sequence, they spin up; once they reach the ZAMS, they begin to spin down due to braking by magnetized winds. Only a handful of rotation periods have been measured for Solar-type stars between 20-100 Myr so far. We propose to fill this gap by measuring rotation periods from TESS full frame images for ~60 Solar-mass stars in six 30-50 Myr-old open clusters. With these data in hand, we will place strong constraints on rotational evolution around the ZAMS, discriminate between models for different core-envelope coupling timescales, and investigate the dependence of activity on rotation in young Solar-type stars.

However the sample of known young planets still remains small, and most orbit faint stars, hindering detailed follow-up. Here we propose to search for exoplanets around stars in nearby young moving groups, using both short-cadence and full-frame images from TESS. With this, we will dramatically expand the number of known infant (<200 Myr) planets, including those orbiting stars bright enough for detailed mass measurements and atmospheric characterization.

This includes planetary structure and atmospheres, system architectures, orbital dynamics, and the studies of exoplanet host star properties. The characterization of known exoplanets is therefore a critical component of the on-going expansion of the field. This proposal aims to ensure that all known southern hemisphere exoplanet host stars are included in the TESS target list. The three main science goals of the observations are: (a) observations of potential transits and phase variations, (b) refined transit ephemerides enabling spectroscopic follow-up with future space-based facilities, and (c) detailed stellar properties through astroseismology modeling.

We propose to use TESS to observe all known lambda Bootis stars to test the hypothesis that their peculiar chemical abundance patterns are a direct consequence of the presence of giant planetary companions. Lambda Bootis stars are A-type stars that were found to exhibit an under-abundance of Fe-peak elements while their abundances of lighter elements are normal. One possible scenario to explain these abundance patterns is that young lambda Bootis stars selectively accrete material from the circumstellar disk which is dynamically separated by the presence of a massive planetary companion. Our proposed study will test this hypothesis.

We expect to measure new rotation periods for >200 Hyads, primarily for stars ignored by previous rotation surveys. Because the Hyades is one of the nearest and best-studied open clusters, empirical calibrations of the age-rotation-activity relation (ARAR) often interpolate between the observed properties of Hyads and those of the Sun. Our TESS data will therefore be critical to improving the anchoring of the ARAR, and will build on our experience with surveys for rotation. Furthermore, combining TESS data with archival and new optical and UV spectroscopy and X-ray observations, we will provide new constraints on the operation of stellar dynamos and on magnetic braking.

This sample will enable important tests of unexpected behavior in the Kepler rotators, allow us to refine physical models of angular momentum evolution, provide anchors for period-age and activity-age relations, and ensure that the potential of rotation periods for stellar characterization is fully realized for broader science with TESS.

Our proposed tool for automatically generating finder charts that include information about variability will support the TESS Community Follow-Up Observing program, other exoplanet observing programs, and other bright-star time-domain investigations across all of astrophysics. This tool will be open-source, easy-to-install, and easy-to-use.

Both of these targets are currently in the JWST GTO programs. However, interpreting the spectra that JWST will soon return requires understanding the energy input at the top of their atmospheres.

Complementary to exoplanetary studies which have found a high proportion of giant planets to their host stars, evidence within our own Solar System has been found for migration of the giant planets during the Solar System's Terrible Twos. Dynamical models suggest that some Kuiper Belt Objects, comets and Jovian resonant asteroids originated in the same source reservoir but unfortunately studies of surface composition are inadequate to test this hypothesis. We therefore propose to use TESS FFI data to study the Jupiter resonant asteroid populations in an effort to determine where they originated.

These systems are especially interesting, since they represent planets at longer orbital periods and therefore a much wider range of equilibrium temperatures. However, without an accurate periods for those planets, it is not possible to schedule future transit observations to measure atmospheric properties or other characteristics. We propose a project that will apply existing photometric data from the KELT transit survey to precover the ephemerides for a significant subset of the TESS single-transit events, including Neptunes out to 25-day periods and Jupiters out to 300-day periods. This effort can be applied to planets detected in both the 2-minute data and the FFIs.

Key stellar properties remain uncertain, notably their magnetic activity, rotation periods, and multiplicity. We propose to gather TESS 2-minute cadence observations of the volume-complete sample of mid-to-late M dwarfs within 15 pc. Short cadence is essential to determine the flare morphologies; we will also measure rotation periods, and precisely measure radii for new-found eclipsing binaries. We will combine the TESS light curves with our ongoing high-res spectroscopic survey to yield a legacy dataset of our closest stellar neighbors.

Active stars can produce superflares, up to 1000x larger than those on the Sun, which may affect planet habitability. Further, frequent small flares can hinder transiting exoplanet detection. We propose to create a census of superflares for active GKM stars in the solar neighborhood using TESS. This program has the potential of discovering thousands of new flare stars across a range of spectral types, and will be key for characterizing the habitability of nearby exoplanets

We will also co-ordinate X-ray observations to be simultaneously performed on some targets, allowing us to study X-ray/optical time-lags on week timescales.

Ultra-cool dwarfs are arguably the most promising hosts for atmospheric and biosignature detection in transiting planets because of the enhanced feature contrast in transit and eclipse spectroscopy. We propose a pilot TESS survey to continuously monitor six of the brightest ultra-cool dwarfs over 27.4 days. To maximize the probability of detecting transiting planets, we have selected only targets seen close to equator-on. Spin-orbit alignment expectations dictate that the planetary systems around these ultra-cool dwarfs should also be oriented nearly edge-on. Any planet detections in our pilot survey will immediately become top priority targets for JWST transit spectroscopy.

We propose short cadence and FFI analysis of all members of the 10-20 Myr old Sco-Cen association, the home of the vast majority of young stars in the nearest 200 pc volume. We will implement PSF fitting for FFI data, apply our young star specific transit-search pipeline to both SC and LC data to identify transiting planets for follow-up, and perform injection-recovery tests to measure occurrence rates at very young ages. In total, we propose to observe 1722 targets with T<13 for 2min cadence.

However, detailed studies of this variability and its relationship to the stellar environment have never been carried out on a large scale. With TESS, we will perform the first comprehensive analysis of light curve morphology among young, intermediate-mass stars and its relationship to magnetic activity as well as circumstellar disk properties. The results will be compared to our previous space-based work on low mass K/M stars in young clusters.

Over 100,000 stars on the Candidate Target List in the CVZ will not have 2-min data, some these will host observable transiting exoplanets. We will discover over 200 planets in the CVZ using FFIs, and swiftly add them to the 2-min target list as ToOs. The new 2-min data, combined with FFIs, will provide a rich dataset to constrain planet and star properties, search for additional planets, and constrain planet masses through transit timing variations. This work provides a major contribution to the yield of the most valuable planets.

These polluted white dwarfs are our best observational probe of exoplanet interior chemical compositions, which they can reveal with exquisite sensitivity. However, without a good understanding of the origins of white dwarf pollution, it is impossible to fully leverage the information about chemical compositions from the pollution on their surfaces. Using TESS we will study the origins and process of white dwarf pollution by identifying transiting disintegrating minor planets on their way to polluting white dwarfs. This will help to properly interpret the information about planetary compositions from the surfaces of white dwarfs.

We propose to address this question by observationally characterizing and constraining magnetic activity in solar-type stars at various phases of their evolution. The proposed TESS observations are part of a large multi-wavelength, multi-observatory campaign where the complete data set will allow us theoretically reconstruct space weather properties including coronal XUV and electromechanical fluxes from winds in solar analogs with ages spanning between 0.13 to 2.5 Gy

The Cannon is a simple, interpretable method which learns the relationship between stellar parameters and stellar brightness variations. It propagates stellar parameters learned from high fidelity data to poorer quality data, so this approach is ideal for TESS where there is a limited number of long light curves (CVZ stars) and a large number of short light curves (single-sector stars). We will provide a catalog of 500,000 rotation periods for FGKM main sequence dwarfs.

Our proposed observations will also enable asteroseismology of a large sample of known and high-likelihood pulsating white dwarfs, continuing the space-based revolution into the interiors of pulsating white dwarfs. From both asteroseismology and spot modulation of magnetic white dwarfs we will significantly expand the number of white dwarfs with measured rotation rates, placing strong constraints on the endpoints of angular momentum in stars.

Ideally, custom cotrending would be performed for each separate research project on each separate light curve and tuned specifically to the signals desired. We propose here to develop a general purpose publicly available tool to allow TESS data users to perform their own TESS pipeline-like correction providing to the user community a dearly needed tool to interpret and utilize the data provided by the mission.

We will augment these TESS data with coordinated multi-wavelength observations contemporaneously planned at ground-based observatories and with the SWIFT satellite.

The study of the long-term behaviour of the optical emission in systems in either states has the great potential to unveil those prone to perform state transitions, to dissect the role of the intra-binary shock between the pulsar and companion winds, and to determine the condition for disc formation and disappearance. We propose to observe at 2-min cadence a sample of 4 redbacks of which 3 are currently in a rotation-powered state and one in an accretion disc-state. The observations will probe the effects of the intra-binary shock in the heated-induced wind of the companion for the 3 former systems, and the long-timescale accretion-induced variability in the latter system.

Inclusion of TESS light curves in our decade-long photometric observations of each blazar is crucial for construction of power spectral densities and determining their characteristics. We will perform a correlation analysis between TESS and Fermi LAT gamma-ray light curves with unprecedented accuracy, providing information on the relative location of gamma-ray and optical emission regions in blazars.

We will also co-ordinate X-ray observations to be simultaneously performed on some targets, allowing us to study X-ray/optical time-lags on week timescales.

We propose to gather TESS 2-minute cadence observations of the volume-complete sample of mid-to-late M dwarfs within 15pc. Short cadence is essential to determine the flare morphologies; we will also measure rotation periods, and precisely measure radii for new-found eclipsing binaries. We will combine the TESS light curves with our ongoing high-resolution spectroscopic survey and existing astrometric data to yield a legacy dataset of our closest stellar neighbors.

                        <div class="accordion-body">Many white dwarfs have been found to have their surfaces "polluted" by remnant rocky bodies from their progenitor's planetary systems. These polluted white dwarfs are our best observational probe of exoplanet interior chemical compositions, which they can reveal with exquisite sensitivity. However, without a good understanding of the origins of white dwarf pollution, it is impossible to fully leverage the information about chemical compositions from the pollution on their surfaces. Using TESS we will study the origins and process of white dwarf pollution by identifying transiting disintegrating minor planets on their way to polluting white dwarfs. This will help to properly interpret the information about planetary compositions from the surfaces of white dwarfs.

This investigation connects efforts to understand surface contributions to asteroseismology with efforts to disentangle photospheric contributions to measurement errors in extreme precision RV data. Both of these are major open problems.

Prior studies have given us strong evidence for cores rotating faster than their surfaces, but only for small subgiant samples. We request observations of 227 high-priority subgiant stars in the northern continuous viewing zone. A one year time series will yield high quality data capable of measuring internal rotation, and we have arranged complementary ground-based data to fully characterize these important targets. This powerful sample will permit tests of gyrochronology and stellar angular momentum evolution theory, and it has other broad applications.

Our program will combine transits, asteroseismology and radial velocities to address key questions such as (i) the occurrence of giant planets as a function of stellar mass, metallicity and evolutionary state and (ii) the mechanism(s) responsible for the inflation of hot Jupiters. Our program is the first near-all-sky survey that systematically combines asteroseismology and transit photometry to precisely characterize exoplanets orbiting evolved stars.

Here, we propose to continue development of the eleanor package for light curve extraction from TESS FFIs. Our open-source package has already been used to find planets and other astrophysical variability in TESS data. We will improve the PSF modeling routines in eleanor to maximize our ability to characterize small signals in crowded fields and our 2-d background models in order to minimize the effects of scattered light from the Earth and Moon.

While major shortcomings prevail in their stellar structure and evolution theory, asteroseismology provides a promising tool for calibrating their internal properties by studying stellar pulsations which probe different depths of the stellar interior. However, due to the limitations of ground based observational campaigns as well as previous space missions, tight observational constraints have only been achievable for a handful of massive stars. With this science case we aim to remedy this situation by studying 73 O and B stars observed by TESS for at least 3 sectors in the northern hemisphere.

That statement is especially true regarding co-moving, co-evolving young associations. Gaia is revolutionizing our understanding of young groups of stars and TESS is well placed to immediately begin complimenting and enhancing our knowledge of these stellar associations and their planetary systems. For this proposal, our team has recovered 3578 confirmed or high-probability members of young moving groups that will have full frame images. We propose to use these stars to establish the rotational period relation for solar to M dwarf stars across 3.7 Myr (Epsilon Cha) - 750 Myr (Hyades) moving groups as well as confirm candidate members through their fits to the relations.

From an analysis of the Gaia DR2 flux errors, we have identified a large number of sdB stars with inflated flux errors for their magnitudes, strongly indicative of variability. Follow-up TESS observations of these systems will lead to the discovery of new eclipsing sdB+dM binaries (HW Vir systems), non-eclipsing reflection effect sdB+dM binaries, and even ellipsoidally-modulated sdB+WD systems. In addition to this discovery work, we request TESS light curves of all known variable hot subdwarf binaries in order to improve modeling of their parameters, and to constrain their masses and eccentricities from Roemer delay measurements.

These products have been shown to be as precise as official NASA data products, and have already led to independent community discoveries.

Despite proliferating theories, however, their physical origin is still unknown. Although common in the X-ray light curves of stellar mass black holes, they are frustratingly elusive in active galactic nuclei (AGN). This discrepancy has serious consequences for the universality of accretion across vast physical scales, but may be due only to a lack of suitable AGN light curves. Bolstered by the discovery of the first candidate optical QPO in a Kepler AGN light curve, we request short-cadence observations of two AGN with high-frequency X-ray QPOs, to search for the same signals or their low-frequency counterparts in optical emission.

The evolution of debris disk incidence and properties contains information about the migration of distant giant planets, the rate of giant impacts, and the late stages of terrestrial planet formation. However, debris disks evolve over timescales comparable to stellar lifetimes, and evolution studies are thus hindered by the difficulties of age-dating field stars. Gyrochronology provides the most robust and efficient means of age-dating large numbers of FGK stars. We propose to measure rotation periods and ages for tens of thousands of solar-type dwarfs detected with WISE and test various models of debris disk evolution.

It will also provide an excellent sample of planets for studying the impact of high-energy radiation upon planetary atmospheric escape.

Ultra-cool dwarfs are arguably the most promising hosts for atmospheric and biosignature detection in transiting planets because of the enhanced feature contrast in transit and eclipse spectroscopy. We seek to continue a Cycle 1 TESS survey to monitor 13 of the brightest ultra-cool dwarfs over 27.4 days. To maximize the probability of detecting transiting planets, we have selected only targets seen close to equator-on. Spin-orbit alignment expectations dictate that the planetary systems around these ultra-cool dwarfs should also be oriented nearly edge-on. Any planet detections in our pilot survey will immediately become top priority targets for JWST transit spectroscopy.

Dips are thought to be caused by circumstellar dust; among T Tauri-like stars they are a probe of inner disk conditions and, around older stars, a signpost of exocomets. Most dipper stars have been identified by eye or metrics of periodicity and asymmetry of the lightcurve. We propose an automated analysis of FFI lightcurves, combining statistical calculations with a novel anomaly detection that separates normal variability from short-duration anomalies, including dips, followed by a deep learning approach to distinguish astrophysical signals from systematics based on co-trends between stars, allowing us to describe more diverse and rare events around a wider range of stars.

Ground based surveys, such as PAN-STARRS and SDSS, are designed for asteroid discovery, and are unable to rigorously identify long period rotation rates. Space-based facilities, such as WISE, do not provide the wide field of view required for an unbiased survey. We propose to leverage TESS s unique capabilities of precise, long-term monitoring across a huge sky-coverage to accurately survey more than 4,000 main belt asteroids, and generate light curves of unprecedented .

To quantify short timescale variability in CTTS, we request 2 minute cadence observations of all of the bright CTTS in the Taurus star-forming region. Our target list consists of 15 CTTS which are the best targets for a study of accretion variability given the wealth of ancillary data. Multiple targets have archival HST UV observations, from which accretion properties have been determined and which will aid in our interpretation of the TESS data.

Over 100,000 stars on the Candidate Target List in the CVZ will not have 2-min data; some these will host observable transiting exoplanets. We will discover more than 200 planets in the CVZ using FFIs, and swiftly add them to the 2-min target list as ToOs. The new 2-min data, combined with FFIs, will provide a rich dataset to constrain planet and star properties, search for additional planets, and constrain planet masses through transit timing variations. This work provides a major contribution to the yield of the most valuable planets.

In addition to enchanting individual-case discoveries and their intriguing dynamics, our sample will enable statistical studies of occurrence rates, formation, and habitability of CBPs (an astonishing ~30% of Kepler CBPs are in the habitable zone), as well as provide a deeper understanding of the formation and evolution of close binary stars.

Most of the CVs in our target list have strongly magnetic white dwarfs, and TESS observations of these systems would revolutionize the study of magnetically-controlled accretion much as Kepler did for non-magnetic accretion in CVs. Additionally, several targets will be visible for many sectors and will offer unique insight into instabilities in the mass-transfer rate on long timescales. These targets are highly variable on timescales of minutes, necessitating a two-minute cadence.

We propose to search for transiting planets around spectroscopically-confirmed FGKM dwarf stars with [Fe/H] < -0.5. We will compare the occurrence of small planets in this metal-poor sample to a control sample of solar-metallicity stars selected in exactly the same way. The proposed observations will conclusively establish or reject the reality of a small planet metallicity effect.

Ground-based observations inform us that young BAF stars are variable due to a combination of accretion (for the Herbig AeBe objects), circumstellar obscuration, and starspots. However, detailed studies of this variability and its relationship to the stellar environment have never been carried out on a large scale. Starting with TESS cycle 1, we are performing the first comprehensive analysis of light curve morphology among young, intermediate-mass stars and its relationship to magnetic activity as well as circumstellar disk properties. The results will be compared to our previous space-based work on low mass K/M stars in young cluster.

Only few systems are known so far and their outbursts not well understood. Recent studies that include more data and exclude upper limits have shown that the relation P_{orb} and superoutburst duration is much flatter than believed. Likely the relations between P_{orb} and recurrence time, and amplitude are strongly affected as well. This has implications for accretion models in AM CVns. For TESS Cycle 2 we request a monitoring of 9 systems at 2 mins cadence and 18 targets at 30 mins cadence to: 1) determine P_{orb} for these 9 systems during outburst, 2) study the characteristics of the outbursts and test existing relations, 3) compare the outbursts of AM CVns and H-rich CVs.

We propose this star as 2-minute cadence target in TESS' cycle 2. The 27-day time coverage of this system will enable the characterization of previousy observed phase variations that cannot be explained by scattered light from the planet. This signal may be due to circumstellar gas or dust in the orbit of 55 Cnc e, that could also be associated with the planet. We will also monitor the time variability of these phase variations, and search for a secondary eclipse. In addition, measuring the planet's radius in the unique bandpass of TESS will allow a comparison with transit depths measured at other wavelengths with HST, JWST and CHEOPS.

We propose to capitalize on the \tess{} FFIs in two ways: 1) At its fastest, TESS data will only be downloaded and made available every two weeks. We will observe the full \tess{} field with an increased cadence (4-6 times per day) using ASAS-SN. We will discover TESS transients first from the ground in real-time to allow extensive multi-wavelength and spectroscopic early-time follow-up observations to complement the exquisite TESS light curves will be made public quickly.

The EBLM program was created to solve this. Over 400 eclipsing binaries have been found with F/G + M stars, with 10+ years of spectroscopy to unveil masses and metallicities. We now require TESS short cadence lightcurves to obtain primary and secondary eclipses, and hence measure the radius and temperature. Our southern sample was already observed in Cycle 1 (G011278), and with the northern targets, we will produce the most comprehensive sample of M-dwarfs known, and significantly refine the mass-radius-composition-temperature relation.

The library of light curves that TESS is building provides an unique opportunity to search for young field stars and the planets they may host.

We will construct a distribution of physical and dynamical properties of small planets as a function of age: an evolution pathway that led to the dominant planet demographic around Sun-like stars.

This is a continuation of a Cycle 2 program, with the addition of new gamma-ray blazars, which is crucial for sampling their properties across different sub-classes and for theoretical modeling. We will perform a correlation analysis between TESS, FERMI LAT gamma-ray, Swift XRT, and radio light curves, and optical polarization data that will provide with unprecedented accuracy the relative locations of high energy and optical emission regions in the jets of blazars.

It will exploit the precision photometry, high-cadence/multi-year baseline, and nearly all-sky coverage of TESS in the search for tenuous nuclear supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion in the local galaxy population compiled in bright galaxy catalogs (e.g., NGC galaxies). The unique combination of TESS capabilities makes it the ideal facility for identifying and characterizing low-level SMBH accretion in the local universe. Based on TESS-detected nuclear variability from FFIs, TEQUILA will identify SMBHs at the centers of NGC galaxies, quantify the duty cycle of flares in low-rate accretion flows and measure their general variability properties.

However, a major shortcoming of stellar evolution models is their large uncertainties for interior rotation and convective core overshooting. This is because we lack detailed observational constraints on massive star interiors. Fortunately, most massive stars pulsate in gravity and pressure modes, which are extremely sensitive to a star's interior physics. The TESS mission is providing the first long-term and high-precision photometric data set for a large sample of massive stars. In this project, asteroseismology applied to 2-min TESS light curves will allow us to mitigate these large uncertainties currently in stellar evolution theory.

We will search the light curves for transiting planets, expecting to triple the number of transiting planets known in clusters. This will shed light on the timescales for processes in planet formation, evolution, and migration. The public data set will also be a gold mine for stellar astrophysics, including studies of gyrochronology, variability and tests of stellar evolution.

To date, this technique relies on one simple, key assumption: the terminator region we observe during transit is homogeneous. In this work, we aim to test this assumption, proposing to detect signatures of terminator inhomogeneities using the most precise transit lightcurves to be obtained by the TESS mission during its extended mission.

In contrast, Kepler allowed us to determine fundamental asteroseismic parameters for hundreds of main sequence stars as well as thousands of red giants. However, despite these successes, a gap remains at the bottom of the main sequence in the asteroseismic HR diagram. Here we propose to attempt to fill that gap using TESS 20-s cadence data. TESS is ideally suited to photometric detection of M dwarf oscillations due to its unique combination of red sensitivity and short observing cadence.

We know from studies of our own Sun that flares, oscillations, and convection can cause variations on timescales of seconds. However, the variation of other classes of stars at small amplitude and fast cadence are relatively unconstrained. We therefore propose to establish a library of 20 second cadence observations of bright, spectroscopically characterized stars across the HR diagram. This has the potential to identify new sources of variability at lower amplitude and shorter period than ever before. In addition, such well sampled light curves will offer opportunities to optimize the cadence of future surveys and to determine the timescales on which stars can be considered to be stable.

The best observational probe of escape is transit spectroscopy with H I Lyman alpha. However, neutral hydrogen in the ISM completely attenuates the core of the line even for the closest stars, hiding the key bound region of a planet's exosphere. High radial velocity stars offer a solution, as transit signals will be Doppler shifted out of the ISM's 100\% attenuation zone. We propose to search for large, short-period planets around 402 nearby, bright, high radial velocity stars to find planet candidates that will be suitable for Lyman alpha transmission spectroscopy with the HST. We expect to find ~10 planets, which will likely become benchmark systems for directly probing atmospheric escape.

We propose an expanded search for young planets using Cycle 3 TESS data. Unlike earlier surveys, here we focus on the trove of marginal and unconfirmed detections from our Cycle 1 search, where additional TESS data is critical to distinguish stellar from planetary signals.

                        <div class="accordion-body">TIC 350146296 was discovered to be a member of the rare class of rapidly oscillating Ap stars through TESS observations. To date, it exhibits the highest pulsation frequencies of any of the roAp stars. These are above the theoretical limit expected in roAp stars, making this star a key for constraining non-adiabatic pulsation models of Ap stars. However, amplitudes in the current TESS data are suppressed by as much as 27%, caused by apodization, thus hampering the detection of further, low-amplitude modes that are required for a full asteroseismic model. We propose to observe TIC 350146296 in the newly available 20-sec cadence mode for the duration of cycle 3 as this star is in the CVZ. This is a prime example of how the shortest cadence observations will maximise TESS science results.

However, the theory of stellar structure and evolution for intermediate- and high-mass stars has major shortcomings, evident even on the main sequence. Resolving these issues requires confronting theoretical predictions with precise measurements of atmospheric and pulsational properties. To complement TESS's high quality light curve data, we propose measuring effective temperature, gravity, metallicity, vsini, and radial velocities for tens of thousands of stars with convective cores and radiative envelopes (M > 1.2 Msun) using the APOGEE high-resolution H-band spectrograph as part of the SDSS-V all-sky survey.

Characterizing the orbits of the stars in such a young system, provides early constraints on the observed distribution of multiple systems giving insight into the formation mechanisms of close stellar binaries.

We have made all data from ZTF coverage of TESS sectors public, with nightly release of alert data on transient and variable objects as well as prompt release of light-curves of all ZTF-detectable objects within a TESS sector. In this proposal, we request funding to continue our program of observations of TESS fields during Cycle 3, enhance the legacy value of public ZTF data acquired in Cycle 2, as well as deliver Cycle 2&3 data to NExScI and MAST.

The main focus was lying on main sequence (MS) and post-MS stars, but first promising results were also achieved for the pre-MS stages. For a successful application of pre-MS asteroseismology we require the observational detection, resolution and identification of individual pulsation modes, and accurate theories of stellar structure and evolution. For many pre-MS delta Scuti stars, TESS is now the first space mission delivering high-quality, uninterrupted photometric time series which allows to tackle some of the open questions of early stellar evolution theory.

                        <div class="accordion-body">The most powerful tests of stellar structure and evolution come from the brightest stars in the night sky, for which complementary observational techniques (such as astrometry, asteroseismology, and interferometry) can be combined. So far, naked-eye stars (V<6) have rarely been observed with high-precision, high-cadence photometry from space telescopes such as Kepler/K2 due to the large number of pixels required to capture the saturated pixel columns. The key goal of this program is to adapt the novel technique of 'halo photometry' which our team has pioneered with K2 and TESS to perform photometry of extremely bright stars, and obtain high-precision 2-minute cadence light curves of all naked-eye stars, and 20-sec for several targets of special interest.

Discovering and characterizing these systems is crucial for constraining binary evolution models and core-collapse supernova mechanisms. We have selected a sample of 2573 objects enriched in BHs that exhibit large RV variations in LAMOST, SDSS, and Gaia data. We would like to use their TESS light curves to search for low-amplitude periodic photometric variations due to ellipsoidal modulation, relativistic beaming, and self-lensing. By combining the currently available radial velocity data and TESS photometry we will be able to create a large sample of BH candidates in non-interacting binary systems, which we will follow up to confirm their nature.

We will use these methods to produce a catalog of stellar rotation periods, ranging from 0.1 to ~60 days, for all bright TESS stars in the South.

This shift-and-stack survey using FFI data will discover hundreds of bright Kuiper Belt Objects, Scattered-Disk Objects and Centaurs, and could discover/constrain Planet-9. The newly discovered objects will: (i) be easy to follow-up for physical characterization; (ii) provide a unique all-sky characterization of the size- and spatial-distribution of outer solar-system objects; and (iii) provide insights into rare populations well away from the ecliptic.

Few superflares have been observed in multiple colors and at high enough cadence to resolve impulsive (10 s) flare emission. Observations are needed to characterize the flare processes in the stellar atmosphere and determine the effects of superflares on the atmospheres of rocky planets. We propose the largest survey of M-dwarf superflares, cataloguing their rapid emission profiles and temperatures with TESS 20 s cadence and simultaneous ground-based observations. 100 events will occur in Cycle 3 within the TESS FoV simultaneously to Evryscope observations, a 10X improvement in the number of superflares.

As such, they are valuable astrophysical laboratories for a variety of processes. Be stars show diverse behavior with widely ranging timescales and magnitudes, necessitating a statistical study of the class. They are bright and relatively common, but tend to lie near the Galactic plane and have largely been avoided by space photometry. TESS thus provides an excellent and rare opportunity to study Be stars, and in particular their pulsational properties which may hold the key as to what drives the enigmatic Be phenomenon. We will obtain spectra and polarization measurements simultaneous with the TESS observations of selected targets.

Only about a dozen were found, however, leaving a vast gap in our understanding -- similar to the state of exoplanet science 20 years ago when only hot Jupiters were known. TESS, and only TESS, will allow us to detect an order of magnitude more CBPs using a new technique we have developed and tested: the occurrence of multiple transits during one conjunction. In addition to enchanting individual-case discoveries and their intriguing dynamics, our sample will enable statistical studies of occurrence rates, formation, and habitability of CBPs (an astonishing ~30% of Kepler CBPs are in the habitable zone), as well as provide a deeper understanding of the formation and evolution of close binary stars.

These polluted white dwarfs are our best observational probe of exoplanet interior chemical compositions, which they can reveal with exquisite sensitivity. However, without a good understanding of the origins of white dwarf pollution, it is impossible to fully leverage the information about chemical compositions from the pollution on their surfaces. Using TESS we will study the origins and process of white dwarf pollution by identifying transiting disintegrating minor planets on their way to polluting white dwarfs. This will help to properly interpret the information about planetary compositions from the surfaces of white dwarfs.

Our primary focus is on temporal phenomena, including measuring rotation rates of the nuclei and investigating changes in the rotation over time, as well as tracking secular activity levels and monitoring for explosive spontaneous outbursts. We will also explore the comets' coma morphologies and search for dust trails that would constrain the comets' total mass loss. TESS' sampling cadence, 27-day observation span, and instrumental stability promise to provide a uniform survey that can dramatically improve our understanding of cometary behavior and evolution.

Collectively, these light curves will help (i) permit detailed asteroseismological analyses for an unprecedented number of pulsating hot subdwarfs; (ii) greatly increase the number of known and solved binaries; (iii) determine the influence substellar objects have on stellar evolution; (iv) constrain the presence of planetary companions through precise timings; and (v) generally improve our capacity to draw a statistically meaningful picture of this enigmatic stage of stellar evolution.

The combined Year 1 + Year 3 data will result in higher quality phase curves, and will allow looking for variations in the phase curve parameters (i.e. weather variability). Our project maximizes TESS s scientific potential by extracting all information encoded in the light curves, leading to characterization of a sample of massive planet atmospheres and studying star-planet tidal interaction.

TESS is an ideal instrument to measure pulsation timings of pulsating sdB stars. Plausible sdB formation channels are common-envelope (CE) ejection, stable Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF), and binary white-dwarf merger. Among these, the CE channel results in short period binary systems (P < 10 days) and the RLOF channel results in long period binary systems (P > 500 days). About 150 short-period sdB systems were studied so far. However, not many long-period sdB systems were studied and more samples are needed to constrain the RLOF channel.

                        <div class="accordion-body">Mass is a fundamental property of stars and is notoriously difficult to measure for red giant (RG) stars. The photometry provided by TESS and Kepler has proven to be a vital resource for measuring accurate RG masses thanks to the scaling relations that connect a star's characteristic oscillation frequencies to its surface gravity and mean density. We are undertaking a spectroscopic study of ~150 RGs to explore the relationship between planet hosting RGs and RGs with unusual properties suggestive of planet engulfment. We request resources to measure asteroseismic masses for the field RGs in our study that are covered by TESS, utilizing full frame images. Having accurate masses will allow us to assess whether our stellar samples are drawn from the same underlying mass population.

The nearest M dwarfs are the most easily studied; moreover, for the coming decade, the only spectroscopically-accessible temperate, terrestrial worlds will be the ones that transit the closest mid-to-late M-dwarfs. Key stellar properties remain uncertain, notably their magnetic activity, rotation periods, and multiplicity. We propose to continue to gather TESS 2-minute cadence observations of the volume-complete sample of mid-to-late M dwarfs within 15 pc. Short cadence is essential to determine the flare morphologies, while continuing observations will reduce the uncertainties on our flare statistics. We will combine the TESS light curves with our ongoing high-res spectroscopic survey to yield a legacy dataset of our closest stellar neighbors.

Our program will yield the first systematic asteroseismic age determination of young moving groups, probe the dynamical architectures of young stars through spin-axis inclination measurements, and shed light on the occurrence rate of delta Scuti stars with regular spacings.

We predict that 3-24 FELTs will be observed by TESS that are detectable to TESTS. We will provide the most comprehensive volumetric occurrence rate for FELTs by determining the magnitude limit, detection efficiency, and contamination factor for every TESS pixel. With TESTS we will produce a catalogue of all FELTs observed by TESS, establish the best occurrence rates, and the nature of these mysterious transients.

Large areas of parameter space remain poorly constrained by observations, however, particularly at low masses and young ages. From the few sources that have been studied in this regime, models have been unable to simultaneously describe their observed properties (M, R, T, L). A thorough test of theoretical models requires a sample of EBs that spans both mass and age. TESS will provide the first dataset capable of finding EBs on this scale. We therefore propose for targeted 2-m cadence observations of 174 EBs discovered by our team that reside in young clusters and moving groups. This analysis will provide a global test of early stellar evolution.

The TESS extended mission promises to bolster this legacy further by finding planets that are smaller and longer-period than those from the prime mission. We have seen that ground-based follow-up is crucial for the identification of false positives and selection of the best targets for our community's most valuable resources. We propose for funding to continue our ground-based observing programs that, in the prime mission, represent a majority of the precise light curves and reconnaissance spectroscopy obtained by the community.

Consisting of a 48 ms pulsar and an O9.5 Ve star with a circumstellar disk inclined to the orbital plane, B1259 shows double-peaked emission at radio, X-ray and TeV energies as the pulsar crosses the Be disk along with powerful flares at GeV energies that at times exceeds the spin-down power of the pulsar. The GeV flares are delayed by 30 45 days and persist up to 90 days from periastron. Our goal is to probe key physical properties of the termination shock and discriminate the synchrotron or inverse-Compton losses driving the strong GeV flares using a discrete cross-correlation analysis from optical to GeV wavelengths.

We propose to obtain 2-minute TESS photometry of 34,140 stars in the Southern Ecliptic Hemisphere whose effective temperatures and V- or T-magnitudes make them viable RV candidates. Planets found to orbit these stars will have the best chances of obtaining precision mass measurements. Such measurements will make these planets prime targets for future atmospheric characterization efforts with ground-based facilities such as NIRSPEC and ESPRESSO, and space-based missions including HST, JWST, and ARIEL. Of these stars, 21,425 were not previously observed in 2-minute cadence by TESS.

We propose to study five highly active M dwarfs, three of which are known planets hosts, using simultaneous TESS 20-second cadence optical data and Swift's X-ray/ultraviolet observations. The combined data will provide a deeper understanding of M dwarf activity in unprecedented detail, enabling us to identify relations between optical, UV, and X-ray activity for low mass stars that will provide valuable inputs into exoplanet atmosphere and habitability models.

MAROON-X has demonstrated sub-50 cm/s radial velocity precision on M dwarfs and it has delivered ultra-precise mass and orbit measurements of two nearby rocky planets during its first year of operations. Over the next year we aim to use this world-leading capability to complete the follow-up of a further 14 M dwarf planets. We will measure precise masses and orbits of these planets to determine the bulk compositions and orbital eccentricities of the individual objects, and the overall mass-radius relationship and the mass function for M dwarf planets.

We will search the light curves for transiting planets, expecting to triple the number of transiting planets known in clusters.

The public data set will also be a gold mine for stellar astrophysics, including studies of gyrochronology, variability and tests of stellar evolution.

Key stellar properties remain uncertain, notably their magnetic activity, rotation periods, and multiplicity. We propose to gather TESS 20-second and 2-minute cadence observations of the volume-complete sample of mid-to-late M dwarfs within 15 pc. Short cadence is essential to determine flare morphologies, rotation periods, and search for transiting planets, while continuing observations will reduce the uncertainties on our flare statistics. We will combine the TESS data with our ongoing high-res spectroscopic survey to yield a legacy dataset of our closest stellar neighbors.

It may have changed color without a strong photometric variability during the 19th century, perhaps caused by ejection of shells. HD 38451 is not known to be chemically peculiar like Am and Ap stars, and it is rotating rapidly unlike Am and Ap stars. Yet it appears to be variable at about 200 cycles per day, similarly to the class of rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) stars. We propose to take advantage of the fact that HD 38451 will be observed with TESS during Sectors 43-45 and obtain nearly uninterrupted 2-min cadence data, so that we may investigate the oscillation characteristics of HD 38451 and its relationship with roAp stars.

However, all studies have so far used an assumption that remains untested: "the metals are uniformly distributed over the stellar surface". Given accretion proceeds via a geometrically thin disk, the validity of this assumption is far from obvious. Exploiting the pulsations in G29-38, the metal distribution can be mapped over the surface. However, the evolution of the location of the pulsations is a necessary step. The exquisite continuous long-term TESS photometry has the potential to reduce the aliases, and only the 20-sec cadence mode can to resolve the shortest pulsations (<2min) in G29-38.

We will examine the dependence of rotation period on binary separation and mass ratio, and use our single-star rotation sequence to test models of M dwarf rotational evolution and calibrate a gyrochronology. Accurate ages for M dwarfs would allow measurements of their planets to be temporally ordered and would refine the timescale for the early phase of elevated X-ray/UV emission and flaring that drives escape of planetary atmospheres.

TESS, and only TESS, will allow us to detect of an order of magnitude more CBPs using a technique recently developed and successfully applied: the occurrence of multiple transits during one conjunction. In addition to enchanting individual-case discoveries and their intriguing dynamics, our sample will enable statistical studies of occurrence rates, formation, and habitability of CBPs, as well as provide a deeper understanding of the formation and evolution of close binary stars.

                        <div class="accordion-body">As Doppler spectrometers approach ever higher precision, stellar activity is becoming the most significant challenge when measuring precise masses of exoplanets. Photometry is a valuable tool for mitigating the effects of stellar activity, especially when taken simultaneously with RVs. We propose to observe high-value Kepler targets using the new, ultra-precise Doppler spectrograph NEID, simulatneously with TESS observations. A joint photometry-RV model will be used to mitigate activity in RVs, and provide precise mass estimates for our targets. Models will be run with Kepler photometry, TESS photometry, and both, with a study of the effectiveness of such models being a primary science result. The results of this project will inform future efforts to measure exoplanet masses with RVs.

As such, they are valuable astrophysical laboratories for a variety of processes. We are using TESS data to quantify their complex variability, especially in regards to pulsation-driven mass ejection and the dynamics of circumstellar material. A ground-based time-series spectroscopic campaign contemporaneous with TESS observations is being pursued for ~150 Be stars. From spectra, the (changing) density, velocity, and temperature structure of circumstellar matter can be inferred. This information, when combined with TESS photometry, reveals the nature of the physical processes acting in Be stars and their disks upon careful analysis.

However, a major shortcoming of stellar evolution models is their large uncertainties for interior rotation and convective core overshooting. This is because we lack detailed observational constraints on massive star interiors. Fortunately, most massive stars pulsate in gravity and pressure modes, which are extremely sensitive to a star s interior physics. The TESS mission is providing the first long-term and high-precision photometric data set for a large sample of massive stars. In this project, asteroseismology applied to 2-min TESS light curves will allow us to mitigate these large uncertainties currently in stellar evolution theory.

Having the precise spectroscopic parameters are crucial for the asteroseismic modeling of these stars, while measurements of the surface abundances provide important constraints on their internal mixing.

Despite the unique role of TESS, to maximize its science ground-based data must accompany it. Here we will provide discovery data and complete ground-based follow-up of the nearest SNe that will be in TESS Cycle 4 (5-7 SNe total), and will utilize new tools to spectroscopically classify SNe minutes after discovery. This array of follow-up data, including a single HST UV spectroscopic sequence, will help break model degeneracies inherent to the single-band TESS data alone.

The combined Cycles 2 + 4 data will result in higher quality phase curves, and will allow to look for variations in phase curve parameters (weather variability). In addition, Cycle 4 ecliptic sectors will provide new phase curves. Our project maximizes TESS s science by extracting all information encoded in the light curves, leading to characterization of a sample of massive planet atmospheres and studying star-planet tidal interaction.

The age and estimated low densities of these planets suggest they are in the end stages of formation when planets radiate away formation heat, contract, and lose some atmosphere. These planets are an excellent laboratory for planetary formation and will be a popular target for atmospheric characterization and to understand formation with JWST. 2 minute cadence data from TESS will reduce transit time uncertainties from several hours to tens of minutes during JWST Cycle 1, enabling transit observations with JWST. The TESS data will also constrain possible transit timing variations, placing an upper limit on the mass of these planets.

Here we propose to use the unique 20-second cadence capabilities from TESS to establish the first benchmark sample of bright asteroseismic solar analogs, which will enable us to (i) investigate the connection between magnetic activity cycles and stellar age in Sun-like stars and (ii) characterize the radii and eccentricities of small transiting exoplanets.

                        <div class="accordion-body">Double eclipsing binaries are systems with two independent but overlapping sets of eclipses. Surprisingly, the population of double eclipsing binaries shows excess near but not exactly at period ratios of 1:1 and 3:2, which is not theoretically understood. Determining the spin state of the individual stars in double eclipsing binaries is the best way to figure out the interplay between tides and dynamical evolution likely responsible for the resonance. We propose to obtain 2-min cadence observations of all known double eclipsing binaries observable in Cycle 4 to determine spin periods of individual components by tracking spots, use the spot eclipses to estimate the obliquity, and search for stellar pulsations.

Observed difference images, created by subtracting average in-transit pixels from out-of-transit pixels, will be compared with modeled difference images that assume the transit is on the target or nearby stars accounting for the measured noise in the observed difference image. Bayesian inference will be used to assign a relative likelihood to the star most likely to host the transit event. Identifying these false positives from TESS data will save significant followup cost. Because our method is automated it can be used to create large, uniformly vetted exoplanet catalogs with well characterized reliability.

Nevertheless, they are of unique scientific importance to understand the interplay between stellar magnetic fields and key physical processes, including convection and chemical element segregation. Depending on this interaction, theory predicts that the pulsations may be excited up to frequencies greater than the 2-min cadence Nyquist frequency. Here, we propose to use the 20-sec cadence TESS capability to observe all 31 roAp stars and 6 strong roAp star candidates in the TESS field of view during cycle 4, to establish the true range of excited frequencies in this class of pulsator. This will be key to test the excitation mechanism and for improving our understanding of the impact of the magnetic field on near-surface convection.

Exoplanets with both photometric and spectroscopic observations are highly prized, as their combined measurements provide details on planetary compositions and the overall nature of the systems. In this proposal, we ask for 2-min cadence for the KELT-24b and HD 332231b systems. We will combine this with simultaneous spectroscopic observations from the world s leading facilities. Our goal is to determine star-planet alignments and characterise stellar surface magnetic variability. The former is important to validate planet evolution theories, and the latter is imperative to help push the Doppler confirmation of exoplanets towards rocky, temperate worlds.

The new and old TESS data will be used to determine ages of young delta Sct stars, study the interaction of strong magnetic fields, atomic diffusion and suppression of convection in roAp stars, measure tidal forces in close binary systems by observing one-sided delta Sct stars, study atomic diffusion and pulsations in chemically peculiar Am/Fm stars and study the interactions between rapid rotation and pulsations.

In contrast, Kepler allowed us to determine fundamental asteroseismic parameters for hundreds of main sequence stars as well as thousands of red giants. However, despite these successes, a gap remains at the bottom of the main sequence in the asteroseismic HR diagram. Here we propose to attempt to fill that gap using TESS 20-s cadence data from a large group of M dwarfs. TESS is ideally suited to photometric detection of M dwarf oscillations due to its unique combination of red sensitivity and short observing cadence.

We propose 20 s cadence observations of a large sample of megaflares from active stars across the sky to measure their impulsive emission profiles, coupled with simultaneous ground-based observations of a subset of events to measure flare temperature and constrain UV emission. This will be the first statistically-robust survey of megaflares at high cadence.

Our proposed 20-second observations will enable asteroseismology of a large sample of known and high-likelihood pulsating white dwarfs, continuing the space-based revolution into the interiors of pulsating white dwarfs. We will also search these white dwarfs for transits of other stars or even remnant planetary systems with at least 2-min-cadence observations; transits of Earth-sized white dwarfs are likely to be very deep but also very short, just a few minutes, requiring high-speed observations.

                        <div class="accordion-body">The intense ultraviolet (UV) emission from stellar flares has given them a pivotal role in the habitability of exoplanets around active M stars. However, current habitability studies often use white-light measurements to predict the UV effects of flares, by assuming the optical blackbody flare spectrum can be extrapolated into the UV. We propose to test the accuracy of these UV predictions by combining white-light flare rates measured from TESS 20 second cadence observations with the observed flare activity in near- and far-UV GALEX lightcurves for a set of M stars. With these combined observations we will confirm whether studies that depend on white-light flare rates can accurately predict the UV flaring behaviour of M stars and thus the UV environments of the planets they host.

K2-138 is one of a small but extremely valuable set of systems for which the planet masses can be measured with both transit timing variations (TTVs) and precise radial velocity (PRV) measurements; fewer than 10 such systems are currently known. Having simultaneous and complementary TTV and PRV observations leads to tighter constraints on the masses, compositions, and eccentricities [1]. K2-138 represents a promising new laboratory for studying multi-planet dynamics.

We propose a systematic approach to quantify the slope of starspot contrast evaluated between the overlapping Kepler and redder TESS passbands. We will target the large sample of 10^4 to 10^5 spotted stars observed in K2 and to-be-observed in TESS Cycle 4. The approach will deliver constraints on plausible starspot temperature contrast as a function of spectral type and rotation rate. We will use only FFIs which are adequate for measuring amplitudes and periods. The non-contemporaneous nature of K2 and TESS requires a large number of head-to-head sources to average over cosmic variance due to stellar activity cycles.

Our goal is to verify the correlation between the NRP regime and the feeding of the envelope by combining ground-based spectroscopy data to identify outbursts and the measurement of small changes in pulsation frequencies with TESS 2-min cadence observations. Fourier analysis of photometric data is performed using a methodology developed for CoRoT and K2 Be stars.

AM CVns are rare systems. Until now we know 58 objects, of which 40 have shown outbursts, which are not well understood. Recent studies that include more data and exclude upper limits have shown that the relation Porb and superoutburst duration is much flatter than previously believed. Likely the relations between Porb and the recurrence time, and the amplitude are strongly affected by upper limits as well. This has implications for accretion models in AM CVns. For TESS Cycle 4 we request monitoring of 30 AM CVns at 20sec cadence to study their outbursts, in particular enhance mass-transfer mechanisms, and to study flares and flickering in persistent systems.

These complex rotators have light curves exhibiting sharp features on short timescales; the periodicity of these features is sometimes well beyond the Nyquist limit of the TESS FFIs. Moreover, these stars' flux modulations exhibit stark changes over time periods of months to years. The most promising models able to explain such variations center on the occultation of stellar features by co-rotating dusty material. This proposal is requesting short-cadence data for six such targets in the North and the ecliptic. Short-cadence data for these targets will enable us to track the changes in these stars' light curves at various epochs and refine existing models for this intriguing class of stars.

TESS is providing us with an unprecedented all-sky photometric sample of bright EBs. By continued observing of ~2200 EBs in Sectors 40-55 with the 2-min cadence, we will acquire a long temporal baseline of observations that allow us to study some of the most pressing questions in binary star physics: what drives multiplicity rates, what determines mass ratio distributions, and what is the impact of binarity on stellar evolution. We also propose using the 2-min cadence targets as a training set for the classifying neural network to harvest ~1 million EB lightcurves from Full Frame Image (FFI) data and disseminate them to the public.

Additionally, we will check whether star light is occasionally blocked by planets, other stars, or dust. TESS' all-sky survey has given us the opportunity to easily monitor the photometric stability of standard stars, which will enable the JWST calibrations team to provide the best possible calibrations of the JWST observations.

Moreover, the oscillations of such stars can be used to precisely measure both stellar and planet properties. We propose to continue the first all-sky survey to detect and characterize giant planets transiting evolved stars using TESS full-frame image (FFI) data. We select stars that allow both asteroseismology and planet transit detection using 10- and/or 30-minute cadence data. This program will allow us to address the occurrence of giant planets as a function of stellar mass, metallicity and evolution, and the mechanism(s) responsible for the inflation and engulfment of highly irradiated planets.

For M dwarf planetary systems, it remains unclear whether this transition arises from thermally-driven atmospheric mass loss or if it is the natural by-product of rocky planet formation in a gas-poor environment. We propose to identify the formation pathway by gathering precise radial velocity measurements with the HARPS-N spectrograph of five keystone planets located within the radius valley. By deducing whether these planets possess gaseous H/He envelopes, we will uncover the dominant emergence pathway of the radius valley around M dwarfs.

Young eclipsing binaries allow precise measurements of stellar masses and radii, providing stringent tests of pre-main-sequence evolutionary models. Short-period young binaries that are accreting from circumbinary protoplanetary disks allow tests of our understanding of disk accretion and angular momentum exchange. Both types of systems are relatively rare but have clear photometric signatures, making TESS ideally suited for their discovery, especially when combined with existing ground-based surveys that have pre-selected young binary stars. We propose a search for examples of these high-value targets using TESS two-minute-cadence lightcurves.

Instead, we propose to use an accurate, reliable, and explainable deep neural network (DNN) designed by mimicking how human vetters utilize all unique elements of a data validation report in order to identify different types of false positives before vetting a TCE. Our model also provides an accurate disposition score so that the domain scientists can focus on the most likely planet candidates for follow up study.

We propose to perform a focused search for the gravitational self-lensing signature using TESS Cycle 4 data in order to make the first discovery of a detached compact object with a stellar companion or, in the absence of a detection, distinguish common envelope formation from field binaries. Detection of these objects will enable studies of their population characteristics and merger histories, complementing studies via gravitational waves. We plan to perform a computationally efficient, GPU-accelerated, compherensive search for black holes binaries in the TESS FFIs down to the 15th magnitude to determine the occurrence rate of these objects.

We will identify single transit planet candidates (STPCs) previously identified from Cycle 2 that re-transit in Cycle 4. After calculating the discreet set of possible transit windows, we will use a robotic and automated half-meter telescope to strategically observe the possible transit windows to uniquely determine the periods of dozens of long-period planet candidates. Once the period is uniquely determined, the orbits and masses of these STPCSs will be measured, and these new additions will improve our understanding of the composition, dynamics and formation of long-period planets.

These polluted white dwarfs are our best observational probe of exoplanet interior chemical compositions, which they can reveal with exquisite sensitivity. However, without a good understanding of the origins of white dwarf pollution, it is impossible to fully leverage the information about chemical compositions from the pollution on their surfaces. Using TESS we will study the origins and process of white dwarf pollution by identifying transiting disintegrating minor planets on their way to polluting white dwarfs. This will help to properly interpret the information about planetary compositions from the surfaces of white dwarfs.

We will also use pre- and post-flare TESS light curves of TDE hosts to search for AGN activity and examine the effects TDEs can have on their environments. We request 25ks of Swift observations to be triggered on a TDE candidate being observed by TESS, providing blackbody temperatures and luminosities concurrent with the TESS observations.

We propose to globally fit observations from TESS and K2, with any available ground-based radial velocity measurements, for all known planets originally discovered by K2 and have transits detected by TESS. We will release a catalogue of refined ephemerides and system parameters to the community and create self-consistent sample of exoplanet parameters for population studies.

With intermediate polars, we will examine how the dynamical nature of the accretion flow onto the white dwarf is impacted by variations in the mass-transfer rate. In-depth observations of these unpredictable phenomena are possible only with continuous, high-cadence observations of a large number of targets, making TESS optimal for this study.

Its spectrum is unique and spectacular, displaying broad emission lines of five-times ionized oxygen. The line widths suggest a wind expanding at 16000 km/s, more than 5% of the speed of light. The wind is seen to have density fluctuations that vary on a times scale of minutes and there are overall brightness changes at the 5% level. In the future, as the wind removes angular momentum from the merged white dwarfs, the remnant may reach a critical density and explode as a supernova. This program proposes to search for the spin frequency of the merger using the 20-sec cadence of TESS. The star's magnetic field may couple its rotation to the wind resulting in a persistent, but weak, photometric signal.

Thermally-driven mass loss and gas-poor formation models can explain the existence of the radius valley but make distinct predictions regarding its location versus stellar mass. Because these model discrepancies are greatest around the lowest mass stars, we propose to target a uniform sample of mid-to-late M dwarfs in the TESS extended mission to resolve the central radius of the valley. The comparison of these measurements to the valley around Sun-like stars will enable the distinction between the competing physical models and will establish what physics drives the sculpting of the close-in planet population around M dwarfs.

Additionally, we will perform the first systematic search for optical quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in all known variable AGN. Any detected QPOs would allow us to constrain the spins of the black holes. TESS is currently the only facility that can provide the uniform, high-cadence data required for the success of this program. We will make all the light curves and the entire transient detection pipeline public.

Combining TESS light curves of an expected 4 Galactic novae with a dedicated ground based follow-up campaign, we will establish for the first time, the diversity of shocks and outflows in novae as a function of viewing angle and white dwarf mass, and illuminate their effects on the evolution of the binary system.

Instead, once stars converge onto tight sequences of slowly rotating stars, they temporarily stall for an unknown but extended period of time. This phenomenon can heavily bias rotation-based ages for low-mass K and M dwarfs. We propose to conduct a census of stellar rotation in nearby (d<400 pc) young (<1 Gyr) clusters, moving groups, and stellar streams with the goal of determining when these tight sequences form, and how long stars remain stalled, as a function of mass. We will use FFI data to extract light curves for ~5000 stars distributed across dozens of coeval groups for this purpose.

We will use a sample of 400 wide white-dwarf main-sequence (WD-MS) binaries to extend the flare-activity-age relations for low-mass stars using high-fidelity ages (10-30%) from their white dwarf companions. We will leverage these binary systems to investigate the evolution of flare rates with time past 1 Gyr, for the first time with precision ages. Quantifying the flare rate in old stars provides a timeline within which to examine questions about the impact of stellar activity on exoplanet habitability.

These phenomena travel on the magnetic field lines in the star's atmosphere. We propose a study of oscillations within flares to place constraints on the interpretation and understanding of the fundamental processes operating in both solar and stellar flares at different layers within the stellar atmosphere. We propose 51 TESS 20-sec data of M-K-G highly active stars and simultaneous data for Swift and TESS 20-sec cade for 3 highly active stars for the study.

We propose to observe all Cycle 4 HJs with TESS's 2-minute cadence in a search for small nearby companions that could help constrain the formation mechanism of HJ systems and calculate the multiplicity rate of this unique planet population. This would generate the first complete and uniform data set of almost all HJ systems down to the precision of TESS, allowing for more detailed population analysis of this mysterious class of planets.

These candidates will be released to the community to allow efficient follow-up. This program will provide giant planets that will be amenable to follow-up studies, enabling constraints on the composition and formation of long-period exoplanets. As added value, this program will allow us to update the occurrence rates of long-period giant exoplanets.

Hence the SMBHs in several nearby systems, including the SgrA*, are all potential candidates to enhance our understanding of gravitation in such extreme environments. However, providing strong constraints on several aspects of the accretion and jet physics in active galaxies that are possible through multiwavelength observations, is vital for the convergence of theoretical simulations of accretion processes. We thus propose a TESS monitoring campaign of ten nearby galaxies, probing for the orbital variability time-scale. Besides, we also seek to address the role of the magnetic field based on the turbulence of the light curves.

Large areas of parameter space remain poorly constrained by observations, however, particularly at low masses and young ages. From the few sources that have been studied in this regime, models have been unable to simultaneously describe their observed properties (M, R, T, L). A thorough test of models requires a sample of EBs that spans both mass and age. TESS provides the first dataset capable of finding EBs on this scale. We therefore propose for targeted 2-m cadence observations of 40 young EB (10-700 Myr) discovered by our team in Cycle 2 and for 4157 young association members that will receive their first TESS observations in Cycle 4.

Additionally, finding the merger rate of white dwarfs below the Chandrasekhar mass can provide important constraints on type Ia supernova rates and on the rate of close double degenerate binaries that will be detected with LISA, as well as help characterizing the contribution to the LISA sensitivity curve by the low-signal-to-noise double degenerates background.

We propose to obtain TESS 20-second cadence optical data and simultaneous Swift X-ray and ultraviolet data.

This would generate the first complete and uniform data set of HJ systems down to the precision of TESS, allowing for more detailed population analysis of this mysterious class of planets.

Until we better characterize these cooler planets, which have been less impacted by photo-evaporation than their hotter counterparts, and some of which may even be hospitable to life, we cannot fully understand the processes that sculpt planetary populations and the prospects for life outside the solar system. We propose an extensive Key Project to identify and characterize two times more long-period exoplanets in TESS Extended Mission 2 relative to TESS primary and first extended missions, and enable follow-up observations of these worlds.

We aim to solve this with 227 eclipsing binaries comprised of F/G/K + M stars, with 12+ years of spectroscopy to unveil masses and metallicities. We require TESS light curves to measure the radius and temperature. We request short cadence observations and funding such that we can develop the most comprehensive sample of M-dwarfs known, significantly refine the empirical mass-radius-metallicity-temperature relation, assisting both exoplanet hunters and stellar modelers.

                        <div class="accordion-body">Gyrochronology is a promising yet flawed clock. Recent studies of open clusters revealed that stars do not spin down continuously. Instead, once stars converge onto tight sequences of slowly rotating stars, they temporarily stall for an unknown but extended period of time. This phenomenon can heavily bias rotation-based ages for low-mass K and M dwarfs. We propose to conduct a census of stellar rotation in nearby (d<1000 pc) young (<1 Gyr) clusters, moving groups, and stellar streams with the goal of determining when these tight sequences form, and how long stars remain stalled, as a function of mass. We will use FFI data to extract light curves for ~5000 stars distributed across dozens of coeval groups for this purpose.

However, a major shortcoming of stellar evolution models is their large uncertainties for interior rotation and convective boundary mixing. This is because we lack detailed observational constraints on massive star interiors. Fortunately, most massive stars pulsate in gravity and pressure modes, which are extremely sensitive to a star's interior physics. The TESS mission is providing the first long-term and high-precision photometric data set for a large sample of massive stars. In this project, asteroseismology applied to 2-min TESS light curves will allow us to mitigate these large uncertainties currently in stellar evolution theory.

Observational evidence points to ongoing tidal decay of their orbits, demanding an accurate and expanded catalog for long-term monitoring, and their phase curves evince highly dynamic meteorology involving disassociation, ionization, and magnetic fields. We propose to use Cycles 1 through 5 TESS data, leavened with ground-based observations, to validate or confirm possible UHJs already identified as ``planetary candidates'' on the Exoplanet Archive.

Yet, further characterization of these planets is hindered by their unknown orbital periods. We propose to refine the ephemerides of TESS single transit and duotransit planet candidates through observations from the Unistellar Citizen Science Network, which consists of 7,000 eVscopes around the world. The Network's longitudinal coverage makes it uniquely suited for long duration transits and poised to enhance the scientific legacy of the TESS mission.

We propose to obtain 20-sec cadence TESS observations of a volume-limited sample of 23 nearby M dwarfs, which we will complement with simultaneous ALMA ACA or SMA millimeter observations. The results of this proposal will increase the sample of stars observed simultaneously with optical and millimeter wavelengths considerably and allow us to study correlations and trends for a statistically significant sample.

The radiation mechanism for the high energy spectral component of blazars is currently under debates. While SED fitting is in general not sufficient to distinguish between models, the geometrical constraints provided by timing analysis can provide new constraints to break the degeneracy. The proposed analysis will significantly increase the sample of lag measurements by a factor of several compared to existing measurements, enabling us to measure the lag distribution between the synchrotron and high energy blazar emission components and provide geometrical constraints that can distinguish models for blazar emission at MeV to TeV range.

These polluted white dwarfs are our best observational probe of exoplanet interior chemical compositions, which they can reveal with exquisite sensitivity. However, without a good understanding of the origins of white dwarf pollution, it is impossible to fully leverage the information about chemical compositions from the pollution on their surfaces. Using TESS we will study the origins and process of white dwarf pollution by identifying transiting disintegrating minor planets on their way to polluting white dwarfs. This will help to properly interpret the information about planetary compositions from the surfaces of white dwarfs.

Recently, thanks to the TESS mission, it has been discovered a planet candidate, similar to the mass of Jupiter and ten times its mass, orbiting a white dwarf (WD) star, which demonstrates that planets can avoid being tidally disrupted by their host star. However, the proportion of planets that can survive being tidally disrupted by their host star or planets that survived the common envelope stage is unknown. In order to address these questions, a selection of hot-WD (Teff>50kK), as obtained from a spectral energy distribution analysis (from UV to optical) and public catalogues, are being proposed to be observed by the TESS mission on its Cycle 5.

However, the host star is a rapidly-rotating $\delta$ Scuti pulsator, which introduces complex additional signals into photometry and complicates parameter estimation. We therefore propose to independently test several key characteristics of WASP-33b by performing a joint transit and asteroseismic analysis using Cycle 5 data. Our analysis will yield improved constraints on the host star's bulk density, rotation rate, oblateness, inclination, and temperature, and will provide independent constraints on WASP-33b's nodal precession.

We propose to use full-frame images from Cycle 5 to perform a study of dust trails, using the observations to constrain trail models that will derive the dust grain properties and the parent comet production rates. Twenty-three periodic comets will appear in Sectors 56-69, and ~15 of them will exhibit trails. The number of trails available offer a statistically significant sample that will produce meaningful constraints on cometary contributions to the Solar system dust inventory.

The wavelet map of the frequencies < 5 1/d shows vivid amplitude and frequency modulations in the timescale ~1.5 2 orbits. The 20 sec cadence observations will enable us to examine the wavelet-map of WASP-33 at the higher pulsational frequencies. We can also investigate the precession of WASP-33b and reconstruct the full phase curves that will lead to better constrains of the interior. The better sampling of 20 sec cadence data will give more accurate times of mid-transits, so enable us to carry out more thorough transit timing variation analysis.

We propose to observe a sample of 970 accreting compact objects (comprising a mix of accreting white dwarfs, neutron stars, and stellar-mass black holes) at 2-minute cadence with TESS and 50 at 20 second cadence. These observations will provide a long-lasting legacy dataset of a variety of accreting compact objects.

In this proposal, we ask for 2-min cadence lightcurves of 51 F, G, K and M type targets. We will combine the TESS lightcurves with archival and new ground-based spectroscopic observations from the world's leading facilities. Our goal is to determine for the first time/refine star-planet alignments and characterise stellar surface magnetic variability. The former is important to validate planet evolution theories, and the latter is imperative to help push the Doppler confirmation of exoplanets towards rocky, temperate worlds.

These stars are necessary to accurately calibrate the absolute and relative flux across different instruments and observatories, a requirement for precise astronomical measurements. TESS has already shown its value in identifying variability larger than 1 percent in a subset of these stars. Here we request to search for variability on stars yet to be observed by TESS and monitor the rest for unexpected variability.

We here propose a joint effort to observe 280 carefully selected, nearby (< 40 pc) late M dwarfs with 20 s cadence in Cycle 5. We select targets where TESS can detect temperate Earth-sized planets with SNR>3 and the ground can immediately confirm them. This strongly expands TESS' reach and impact to the most interesting targets for JWST and the ELTs. As a free byproduct, we can study stellar flares on an under-explored sample in unprecedented detail, adding pivotal data on the interaction between stars and planets.

Rates of stochastic flares on the Sun are observed to vary by at least an order of magnitude from activity cycle maximum to minimum. Flares should therefore be one of the highest-amplitude indicators of activity cycles for nearby stars. We propose to analyze 2-min light curves for 736 dwarfs that previously had at least 20 flares observed by TESS. By generating per-Sector flare rates, and leveraging the now 5-year baseline of TESS, we can study activity cycle variation on months to years timescales.

We discuss that higher cadence observations of the brightest very-low-mass stars will add an additional 1-5 planets in Cycle 5, doubling the yield expected from FFI frames. This magnitude limited sample, which was systematically built, will provide stronger constraints on the planet occurrence rate for the lowest-mass stars.

                        <div class="accordion-body">Tidally tilted pulsators are stars in tight binary systems whose pulsation axis is pulled into alignment with the binary's tidal axis. The first four tidally tilted pulsators were all discovered with TESS, and there is now conclusive proof that TTPs can occur in evolved stars. However, many unanswered questions about TTPs remain, including why only certain stars in tight binaries exhibit TTPs, and others do not. With this proposal, we seek short-cadence data to study tidally tilted pulsations in a set of candidates identified during prior stages of the TESS mission. This will allow for the first comprehensive census of TTPs and will allow for the inference of population-level properties of these unique stars.

In Cycle 5 TESS will uniquely produce high-dynamic range, high-cadence 200-second FFI light curves for large amplitude, bright transients. We have developed two FFI pipelines using the first ~4 years of data and we will continue to improve these pipelines to better correct for systematics. Here we propose to bring the lightcurves to the people by creating a TESS FFI light curve server that is publicly accessible, easy to use, and utilizes an interface already familiar to a large fraction of the community.

The UV emission from flares is an important part of this picture, yet K stars have been overlooked relative to M stars. To estimate the UV activity of K stars current studies must either use UV flare rates measured for M stars, or extrapolate white-light measurements into the UV. We propose to test the accuracy of these UV predictions by combining white-light flare rates measured from TESS 20-s cadence observations with the observed flare activity in near-UV GALEX lightcurves for 4379 main sequence K stars. We will assess whether studies using white-light flare rates can accurately predict the UV flaring behaviour of K stars and thus the UV environments of the planets they host.

We will infer the dependence of spot filling factor on metallicity and Rossby number with 1,500 dwarf targets, 415 with simultaneous light curves and spectroscopy. Our 1,000 evolved active stars (300 simultaneous) will be a powerful resource for population studies and the correspondence of single and binary star activity. Simultaneous data allows us to map TESS spot modulation amplitude to star spot filling factor, which has broad applicability.

Our goal is to verify the correlation between the NRP regime and the feeding of the envelope by combining ground-based spectroscopy data with the identification of outbursts and the measurement of small changes in pulsation frequencies with TESS 2-min cadence observations. Fourier analysis of photometric data is performed using a methodology developed for CoRoT and K2 Be stars.

However, AGN X-ray and UV/optical light curves are often poorly correlated, which challenges this assumption. We can test whether or not AGN UV/optical variations are reprocessed X-rays by searching for a correlation between X-ray reflection features measured by NICER and optical variations measured by TESS; such a correlation must exist if X-ray reprocessing drives AGN variability. Simultaneous TESS and Swift data can also constrain the total reprocessed energy and predict the X-ray reflection strength, which provides a second test. We propose coordinated observations of Mrk 359 with TESS, NICER, and Swift to carry out these tests of X-ray reprocessing.

Oscillations have not yet been detected at the lowest-mass end of the main sequence, although they were predicted several years ago. TESS has a unique combination of red sensitivity and short observing cadence, which makes it ideally suited to photometric detection of M dwarf oscillations. If detected, these would be a true breakthrough in oscillation detection. M dwarf oscillations would also provide an independent way to estimate mass, radius and effective temperature, which could help fix the existing discrepancies between observations and models. In this proposal we attempt to measure M dwarf oscillations using the TESS 20 second cadence data on the best targets available.

However, professional facilities are limited to a few nights of observations, limiting analysis to small samples. In contrast, amateur astronomers can observe targets for weeks and can obtain photometry and spectroscopy simultaneously with TESS, allowing us to measure the temperatures and emission line energies of larger samples of white-light flares. We propose for 20-s cadence photometry of 9 active K and M stars that can be simultaneously observed by amateur astronomers, to study and characterise these energetic events. This target list will be made public for use by our team and the wider amateur community.

TESS provides high-cadence, high-precision photometry unequalled by any other observatory. We expect TESS to detect 2+ TDEs in Cycle 5, and TESS data obtained at or before peak light are useful for constraining the properties of the star and the black hole, while data taken after peak can be used to search for short timescale variability that indicates changes in the accretion rate. Existing pre-flare TESS observations of the host galaxies of 10+ additional TDEs found in Cycle 5 will be used to search for signs of host variability and the presence of an underlying AGN.

AM CVns are rare systems. Until now we know 70 objects, of which 45 have shown outbursts, which are not well understood. Recent studies that exclude upper limits have shown that the relation Porb and superoutburst duration is much flatter than previously believed. Likely the relation between Porb and the recurrence time is strongly affected as well. This has implications for accretion models in AM CVns. For TESS Cycle 5 we request monitoring of 51 AM CVns at 20sec cadence to study their outbursts, in particular, to study the superhump evolution and further investigate the presence of enhance mass-transfer mechanisms recently identified in these binaries.

As such, they are valuable astrophysical laboratories for a variety of processes. We are using TESS data to quantify their complex variability, especially in regards to pulsation-driven mass ejection and the dynamics of circumstellar material. A ground-based time-series spectroscopic campaign contemporaneous with TESS observations is being pursued for ~150 Be stars. From spectra, the (changing) density, velocity, and temperature structure of circumstellar matter can be inferred. This information, when combined with TESS photometry, reveals the nature of the physical processes acting in Be stars and their disks upon careful analysis.

TESS Cycle 5 data will allow uniquely precise and accurate variability monitoring on time scales varying from hours to years, important for identifying low mass nuclear black holes, and in large enough numbers to constrain the AGN fraction in Green Peas.

                        <div class="accordion-body">Stellar atmospheres encompass an abundance of waves and oscillations driven by flares. Oscillatory and pulsating signatures, commonly known as quasi-periodic pulsations, are observed at many wavelengths during both solar and stellar flares and are observed in the flare decay branch in stellar light curves. These phenomena travel on the magnetic field lines in the star's atmosphere. We propose a multiwavelength study of oscillations within flares on solar-type stars to place constraints on the interpretation and understanding of the fundamental processes operating in both solar and stellar flares at different layers within the stellar atmosphere. We propose 48 TESS 20-sec data of highly active G-K stars and simultaneous TESS-Swift-NICER data for 4 highly active flaring stars for this study.

We propose to extend the capabilities of a software toolkit that is being developed to compare correction approaches and apply it to large samples of different target types that cycle 5 will provide from all cadence observations, 20-s, 2-min, and particularly 200-s FFIs. This will produce statistical conclusions on which technique performs best on each target class and set of instrumental effects. The software will be publicly released to facilitate community analyses.

We propose a Key Project to use a select set of premier ground-based facilities to observe primarily small (Rp < 4 Re) TOIs identified in TESS Cycles 5, 6, and 7, rule out NEBs, detect false positives, and refine orbital and physical properties of the system. These observations are crucial for planning PRV and atmospheric observations. We will also support TFOP and TESS GI proposed observations of other interesting targets as available telescope time allows.

Asteroseismology provides a powerful tool to determine fundamental properties such as mass and age, but due to the small amplitudes and fast timescales of oscillations in solar-type stars only a small number of detections have been made using space-based photometry. Here we propose to use the unique 20-second cadence capabilities from TESS to establish a benchmark sample of bright asteroseismic solar-type stars, which will enable us to (i) investigate the connection between magnetic activity cycles and stellar age in solar-type stars and (ii) characterize the fundamental properties of exoplanet host stars.

We propose to measure periods from ZTF light curves, complementing those from TESS by reaching longer periods and fainter stars. We will also collect large samples of high-resolution spectra for each cluster. In summary, we will (1) establish 7 clusters as new benchmarks for stellar astrophysics using new [Fe/H] data, (2) produce extensive kinematic, rotation, activity, lithium, and other abundance data for a large number of their members, and (3) retune rotation, activity, and Li clocks.

TESS has already identified more such stars and with new data from TESS Cycle 5, the majority of these stars will have sufficient data for detailed measurements. We therefore propose to perform an asteroseismic analysis for ~1000 metal poor stars, and to provide a catalog of results including masses and ages, as well as information for stars from interesting populations, including stellar streams associated with galaxy mergers.

They are a unique comparison sample to single-star planets, testing the limits of planet formation. Slightly more than a dozen planets have been found, but the field has plateaued, limited by rudimentary by-eye detection methods and Kepler's limited sky coverage. Only with TESS and the latest automated Stanley detection algorithm can we more than double the number of CBPs. In addition to individually interesting new systems, our TESS sample will enable a broad study of the occurrence rate, habitability and formation of CBPs. Brighter stars will also assist RV follow-up, which was recently demonstrated for CBPs for the first time.

We will obtain TESS 20 second cadence observations of old stars in wide-separation binary systems with a white dwarf, derive ages for the star from asteroseismology, then compare to ages independently estimated for the white dwarf companion. This will serve as a validation and cross-check for the usage of both methods as accurate chronometers and pave the way for making age estimates for as many single nearby old stars as possible.

We propose to use the Cycle 6 FFIs to make light curves for all T<16 K- and M-dwarfs within 100pc. By searching these stars for new CPVs, we expect to double the sample of known CPVs within 100pc. We will also release the light curves to MAST. Independently, we propose that new 2-minute observations be acquired for CPVs that we have found in the Cycle 1-5 2-minute data, to determine how CPV variability changes over thousands of cycles. These efforts will advance our understanding of M-dwarf evolution, including perhaps the evolution of debris disks and young rocky planets.

This difference suggests that intra-system uniformity arises from evolutionary, rather than formative processes. However, we are far less sensitive to small planets in young systems than old ones. In many young multi-planet systems, a planet hiding just below our detection threshold could explain away some of the differences. To explore this, we propose for higher-cadence TESS data of known young planetary systems. The new data and better cadence, combined with improved light curve extraction and search methods, will increase our sensitivity by 20-50%. With this, we can separate out effects of evolution and detection biases.

However, a major limitation of stellar evolution models is their uncalibrated prescriptions for interior rotation and mixing processes. This is because we lack detailed empirical constraints on massive star interiors. Fortunately, most massive stars pulsate in pressure and gravity modes, which are highly sensitive to a star s interior physics. The TESS mission is providing the first set of long-duration and high-precision light curves for a large sample of massive stars. In this project, asteroseismology applied to 2-min TESS light curves will allow us to mitigate the large rotation and mixing uncertainties in stellar evolution theory.

Despite the unique role of TESS, to maximize its science return ground-based data must accompany it. Here we will provide discovery data and complete ground-based follow-up of the nearest SNe that will be in TESS Cycle 6 (~5 SNe total) and will utilize new tools to spectroscopically classify SNe minutes after discovery. This follow-up data, including access to high cadence Swift ultra-violet light curves, will break model degeneracies inherent to the single-band TESS data alone.

Unfortunately, detection biases against finding planets around young stars makes it hard to study the underlying physical drivers of this change. Mass measurements for young planets are critical, but radial velocity surveys of young systems are often overwhelmed by stellar activity. A technique that can overcome this challenge is Transit Timing Variations (TTVs). We aim to search for TTVs in 38 systems known to host young planets. Several already show TTVs or have periods near mean-motion resonances. This project will aid in elucidating the underlying physical processes driving planet size evolution and contribute to our overall understanding of planetary formation and evolution.

The relationship between the corona and the accretion disk represents a major gap in our understanding of AGN central engines. We propose to use awarded time on the VLBA, in addition to the requested TESS and NICER observations, to definitively confirm or rule out the coronal origin theory and motivate a new multi-wavelength means of investigating causal relationships in the central engine.

First, we aim to extend the number of known transiting BDs and to re-analyse previously known systems using new TESS data combined with Gaia DR3 parallaxes. Second, we plan to search for asteroseismic signatures of confirmed BD host stars and to assess their fundamental parameters using advanced stellar modeling and scaling relations.

Those modulations are shaped by atmospheric processes in the planet s atmosphere and by star-planet gravitational interaction. We propose to extend to Cycle 6 our ongoing systematic study of TESS phase curves. Combining Cycle 6 data with that of previous Cycles will extend the time baseline of TESS data, allowing to look for variations in planetary atmospheric properties, and, result in higher quality phase curves. Our project maximizes TESS s science by extracting all information encoded in the light curves.

As such, they are valuable astrophysical laboratories for a variety of processes. We are using TESS data to quantify their complex variability, especially in regards to pulsation-driven mass ejection and the dynamics of circumstellar material. A ground-based time-series spectroscopic campaign contemporaneous with TESS observations is being pursued for ~200 Be stars. From spectra, the (changing) density, velocity, and temperature structure of circumstellar matter can be inferred. This information, when combined with TESS photometry, reveals the nature of the physical processes acting in Be stars and their disks upon careful analysis.

Many TDE models are sensitive to the early-time TDE emission, a phase that is poorly constrained. We propose to use the high cadence and high precision photometry of TESS to probe the early phases of TDEs, which encodes information on the disrupted star and central SMBH. Strong constraints on TDE rise times and slopes will inform theoretical models on how the first light from TDEs is produced. We will also use TESS to place deep limits on the variability of TDE host galaxies and understand potential AGN activity. We expect TESS to detect at least 2 new TDEs in Cycle 6 during flare and that there will be at least 10 additional TDEs with pre-flare TESS observations of their host galaxy.

Far-reaching observations in the NCVZ will uniquely capture the stellar variability of many stars within the Galactic thick disk and halo populations that were only sparsely explored by previous asteroseismic surveys. We propose to measure the stellar pulsations of red giants in the NCVZ using Full Frame Images to determine their asteroseismic ages. Supplemented by present large spectroscopic surveys, these measurements will shed light on the formation history and development of old Galactic populations at much broader spatial scales than ever before.

TESS is ideally suited to observe distant minor planets at scale due to its space-based vantage point, near-all-sky coverage, and continuous observing cadence. However, no framework currently exists to systematically extract these signals from the TESS dataset. We propose to develop and release an open-source linear shift-stacking program that will enable the rapid detection and follow-up of solar system minor planets in the TESS dataset, with an emphasis on relatively distant and faint objects in Cycle 6. We will apply the developed framework to report minor planet candidate tracklets for the full Cycle 6 dataset.

Their photometric modulations also suggest surface features of magnetic origin, through a convective dynamo driven precisely by this anomalous rotation. Photometric transients associated with flares, which should in principle also result from this dynamo action, had been observationally inaccessible owing to temporal undersampling at 30-minute cadence, save for a very select few red giants previously targeted at short cadence. The new availability of 200 second full-frame images (FFIs) now permits TESS to probe time-domain magnetic activity of essentially all visible RRRGs in a hitherto observationally inaccessible temporal regime. We propose to study this activity.

Hot planets lose mass, forming a circumstellar gas shroud concentrated around the planet's orbital plane. For edge-on orbits, this gas absorbs in the stellar chromospheric emission lines. Thus the presence of hot, mass-losing planets depresses a star's apparent chromospheric emission. For intrinsically inactive stars, this effect suppresses the chromospheric emission to an impossibly low level. Our target FGK stars have been selected for their anomalously low chromospheric emission. We propose for 20s cadence light curves and 120s FFIs for 8 bright nearby targets expected to be hosts of hot low mass planets in edge-on orbits.

The most promising formation scenarios for sdB stars involve the evolution of close binary systems through three different channels: 1) the Common Envelope channel, which produces short-period (P = 0.1-10 d) sdB binary systems; 2) the Roche Lobe Overflow channel, which results in long-period (450 < P < 1400 d) sdB binary systems; and 3) the white-dwarf merger channel, which produces single sdB stars. Observational studies of the orbital parameters of binaries with P > 100 d and the existence of single sdB stars are incomplete using conventional methods. Therefore, pulsation timing methods are suitable for these research areas.

We propose a Key Project to use a select set of premier ground-based facilities to observe primarily small (Rp < 4 Re) TOIs identified in TESS Cycles 6 and 7, rule out NEBs, detect false positives, and refine orbital and physical properties of the system. These observations are crucial for planning PRV and atmospheric observations. We will also support TESS GI and TFOP proposed observations of other interesting targets as available telescope time allows.

Young planets can constrain key processes that drive the early evolution of planetary systems and inform our understanding of various properties observed in the older exoplanet population. Stellar activity plays an important role in this evolution, especially at young ages. We will search for young transiting planets and characterise the early evolution of stellar flare activity to understand the subsequent diversity and habitability of planetary systems. We additionally propose 20-sec cadence observations of 30 potentially young TOIs to facilitate detailed transit and flare analyses in these systems.

Their value for astrophysical study is rooted in the combination of the strengths of binary star and asteroseismic analyses; pulsational mode identifications can be achieved because the oscillations are visible over nearly 360 degrees of aspect throughout the orbital cycle. Here, we propose 24 of such objects or candidates for 20-sec or 2-min cadence, four for the first time and the remainder for continued observations for deeper study.

We propose to capitalize on the TESS FFIs in cycle 6 in two ways: 1) At its fastest, TESS can only discover transients after downlinking its data. To alleviate this delay, we will observe the full TESS field with an increased cadence (4-6 times per day) using ASAS-SN. 2) We will spectroscopically classify all bright transients discovered in the TESS footprints using the SCAT survey. The combination of the two will allow the community to obtain the crucial multi-wavelength data needed to put the TESS data in context.

Over 3000 have been identified via spectroscopy, but the orbital periods for the majority of those systems are unknown. TESS photometry is the ideal tool to detect the percent-level optical variations induced by reflection, ellipsoidal modulation and starspots that reveal the orbital period. We will survey over 500 systems, expecting to detect at least 100 new orbital periods. We will also calculate flare frequency distributions for the main-sequence stars, comparing them as a function of rotation period with single stars.

Recent outbursts observations have demonstrated their unique behavior, challenging traditional accretion models, but their understanding is very limited given the small number of known systems. Very often AM CVns are misclassified as H-rich cataclysmic variables (CVs) by ground-based surveys given the limited photometric coverage. We propose to perform a TESS survey on 1397 transients classified as "CV candidates" to uncover the hidden population of outbursting AM CVs. We will obtain the best estimate of the AM CVn population density, while studying their outburst characteristics. Our project will provide to the astro-community the largest catalog of CV ligthcurves to be used for observational/theoretical studies.

These bursts start as X-ray flares of durations typically of about 10-100 seconds, and the X-rays then heat the outer parts of the accretion disks so part of their emission is reprocessed into the optical band. The recurrence time of the bursts is set by the time it takes to accrete a pile that heats up enough to trigger CNO burning, and understanding the recurrence time as a function of accretion rate yields key information about nuclear physics. TESS's continuous coverage and wide field are needed to estimate the recurrence times, which have been hard-to-impossible to measure over the 50 years in which these bursts have been observed to date.

Changes in rotation periods, flux amplitudes, and flare rates over the Sectors 73-83 will be used to measure short activity cycles, which are expected for stars with short rotation periods (<20 days). FGKM dwarfs are expected to have rotation periods longer than 0.5 days, such that the cadence of the TESS FFIs are sufficient for measuring changes in timing and flux amplitudes of each stellar rotation. Characterizing stellar activity cycles for a large sample of stars will help reveal their impact on exoplanet atmospheres, uncertainties in stellar properties, and stellar interior processes.

We also propose to observe a subset of white dwarfs with known rapid variability detected by previous TESS data, including many white dwarfs in eclipsing compact binaries as well as some transiting planetary debris systems. Our proposed science case requires the fastest cadence available from TESS, and will expand the largest catalog of rapid variability in white dwarfs ever created.

Instead, once stars converge onto tight sequences of slowly rotating stars, they temporarily stall for an unknown but extended period of time. This phenomenon can heavily bias rotation-based ages for low-mass K and M dwarfs. We propose to conduct a census of stellar rotation in nearby (d<1000 pc) young (<1 Gyr) clusters, moving groups, and stellar streams with the goal of determining when these tight sequences form, and how long stars remain stalled, as a function of mass. We will use FFI data to extract light curves for ~12,500 stars spread across dozens of coeval groups for this purpose, including 1050 stars in 9 group receiving their first TESS data in C6.

We also collected large samples of high-resolution spectra for each of ten clusters. We will (1) establish each as new benchmarks for stellar astrophysics using newly derived [Fe/H] and reddening, (2) produce extensive kinematic, rotation, activity, lithium, and other abundance data for a large number of their members, and (3) retune rotation, activity, and Li clocks.

We propose to search for TTVs in all known hot Jupiter and multi-planet systems observable by TESS in Cycle 6 in high cadence mode. We will also use the TESS full-frame images to update the ephemerides of all planets. These observations will greatly inform theoretical models of orbital decay, provide constraints on the role of orbital resonances in the evolution of multi-planet systems, and yield updated ephemerides to aid in follow-up observations.

We perform simultaneous high-time cadence observations (~20 seconds) with both TESS and ground-based telescopes. Our approach involves the utilization of custom narrow-band filters attached to the Apache Point Observatory's 3.5m and 0.5m telescopes. Our aim is to create an unprecedented catalog of Balmer jump ratios and multi-color emission properties of TESS flares. We plan to investigate how these properties evolve during the flare time, and discuss the physical mechanisms that determine flare heating rates. Our study will enable us to more accurately estimate flare energy and provide a critical constraint for the flare activity emission effects of the host star on the surrounding exoplanets.

While much progress has been made to understand M dwarf activity processes, a clear picture of their stellar winds remains elusive. Fortunately, close binary systems containing a white dwarf and an M dwarf are unique laboratories to measure M dwarf wind rates as wind material accreted onto the WD may be detectable with UV/optical spectroscopy. We propose to target 7 WD-MD binaries to assess their flare rates and orbital periods. These data will deepen our understanding of WD physics, binary star evolution, the connection between M dwarf flare rates and winds, and the joint impact of these processes on planetary atmospheres.

One open problem in Galactic dynamics is empirically characterizing the timescale of transient spiral arm passages. Simulations have shown that spiral arm interactions can shepherd young stars from near-circular to eccentric orbits. These leave post-resonance "wrinkles" in kinematic-space, which have now been observed with the Gaia mission. With photometry from TESS and gyrochronology, we will measure rotation periods and infer ages for young, low-mass stars in wrinkles. This, for the first time, will place upper-limit timestamps on the most recent spiral arm passages in the Milky Way and improve our understanding of dynamical evolution in the disk.

They are also hot enough to host clouds, which affect the atmosphere's thermal structure and may drive observable variability. We propose to uniformly constrain albedos and assess variability for a sample of 24 HJs with multiple sectors of TESS phase curves. For at least 6 HJs in our sample, we can compare phase curve measurements of equatorial jet velocity with constraints from phase curves. We may even break the degeneracy between albedo and jet velocity for targets that are expected to have such a degeneracy from energy balanced models. We aim to validate a preliminary positive correlation between albedo and dayside temperature and seek evidence of temporally varying cloud coverage and advection.

Unfortunately, detection biases against finding planets around young stars makes it hard to study the underlying physical drivers of this change. Mass measurements for young planets are critical, but radial velocity surveys of young systems are often overwhelmed by stellar activity. A technique that can overcome this challenge is Transit Timing Variations (TTVs). We aim to search for TTVs in 39 systems known to host young planets. Several already show TTVs or have periods near mean-motion resonances. This project will aid in elucidating the underlying physical processes driving planet size evolution and contribute to our overall understanding of planetary formation

Slightly more than a dozen planets have been found, but the field has plateaued, limited by rudimentary by-eye detection methods and Kepler's limited sky coverage. Only with TESS and the latest automated Stanley detection algorithm can we more than double the number of CBPs. The addition of cycle 7 is more essential for a CBP study than for a study of planets around single stars, owing to the typically long-period orbits of CBPs. In addition to individually interesting new systems, our TESS sample will enable a broad study of the occurrence rate, habitability and formation of CBPs. Brighter stars will also ass

We aim to solve this with 326 eclipsing binaries comprised of predominantly F/G/K + M stars. 15+ years of spectroscopy has unveiled masses and metallicities. We now require TESS light curves to measure the M dwarf radius and temperature. We request short cadence observations and funding such that we can develop the most comprehensive sample of M-dwarfs known, significantly refine the empirical mass-radius-metallicity-temperature relation, assisting both exoplanet hunters and stellar modelers.

Unfortunately, spot properties vary with age and stellar type, and we do not know what kind of complementary observations are required to extract spot properties. Here we propose a ground-based campaign simultaneous with TESS Cycle 7 observations of five young planet hosts. Our campaign will include observations over multiple rotation periods, which we will use to extract empirical spectra of the surface and spotted region of the star. We can then explore how reliably we can infer the stellar surface as a function of the data type and quality.

We propose to extend to Cycle 7 our ongoing systematic search for temporal atmospheric variability on short-period planets. This is motivated by theoretical expectations and observational claims. Combining Cycle 7 data with that of previous Cycles will extend the time baseline of TESS data and allow looking for variations in planetary atmospheric properties, and, result in higher quality phase curves. This work maximizes TESS s science by extracting all properties encoded in the light curves, and search for their temporal variability.

Here we propose to use the unique 20-second cadence capabilities from TESS to establish an all-sky benchmark sample of bright asteroseismic solar-type stars, which will enable us to: (i) investigate the connection between magnetic activity cycles and stellar age in solar-type stars and (ii) characterize the fundamental properties of exoplanet host stars.

These effects combine to create a composite background signal that is strong and varies in time. The TESS data reduction pipeline does not correct the background in FFIs and current extraction pipelines focus mainly on creating light curves. These pipelines rely mostly on local estimations of the background or do not account for all its components. This leads to losing 10-30% of light curves due to suboptimal background modeling. In this proposed work we will use a neural network model to predict the FFI background.

From these long baseline flare studies, we will search for traces of activity cycles. We have developed a pipeline to characterize flare rates and perform injection-and-recovery testing, characterizing flare rate completeness never before done on a large scale. Our sample selection of continuous viewing zone stars enables us to both constrain activity variations on years timescales (i.e.\ between TESS Cycles), and on short timescales (i.e.\ between TESS Sectors). This will be the first systematic study of flare activity variations on both short- and long-timescales.

However, a major limitation of stellar evolution models is their uncalibrated prescriptions for interior rotation and mixing processes. This is because we lack detailed empirical constraints on massive star interiors. Fortunately, most massive stars pulsate in pressure and gravity modes, which are highly sensitive to a star's interior physics. The TESS mission is providing the first all-sky, long-duration and high-precision light curve data set for the largest ever sample of massive stars. In this project, asteroseismology applied to 2-min TESS light curves will allow us to mitigate the large rotation and mixing uncertainties in stellar evolution theory.

However, there are only 121 roAp stars, representing just 5.5% of the Ap star population. With the potential to provide far reaching impacts on stellar physics, an expansion of this population of pulsating star is a worthwhile endeavour. Here we propose to significantly increase the number of known roAp stars by an expected 40 members through TESS 2-min observations of stars newly classified as Ap using LAMOST spectra. This will provide the an unrivalled legacy sample of roAp stars for ensemble studies with which a broad spectrum of stellar physics can be explored.

Both have approved imaging observations with JWST. K2 data for the first target shows a factor of two variation in brightness with an ~8 day period, while the second target has never been monitored before. We reguest 2 min cadence of observations of both targets during Sector 91. The results will test the hypothesis that stellar accretion hotspots are the source of the observed beaming in the disk reflected light, by observing one edge-on disk with strong accretion sigantures and one without.

Many TDE models are sensitive to the early-time emission, a phase that is currently poorly constrained. We propose to use the high cadence and high precision photometry of TESS to probe the early phases of TDEs, which encode information on the disrupted star and SMBH. Strong constraints on TDE rise times and slopes will inform theoretical models on how the first light from TDEs is produced. These parameters may also connect to the environment surrounding the SMBH. TESS will also place deep limits on pre-existing AGN activity in TDE host galaxies. We expect TESS to detect at least 1-2 new TDEs in Cycle 7 as well as 10 additional TDEs with pre-flare TESS observations of their host galaxy.

New pulsation periods will add valuable new constraints on white dwarf interior structures. With Cycle 7 data, we will characterize the evolution of pulsation signals from space on timescales of up to 7 years, and we will detect new pulsational outbursts. We will publish the definitive catalog of white dwarf pulsation periods and mode characteristics as seen by TESS, which is expected to serve as a key reference for future asteroseismic studies.

Young planets can constrain key processes that drive the early evolution of planetary systems and inform our understanding of various properties observed in the older exoplanet population. Stellar activity plays an important role in this evolution, especially at young ages. We will search for young transiting planets and characterise the early evolution of stellar flare activity to understand the subsequent diversity and habitability of planetary systems. We additionally propose 20-sec cadence observations of 30 potentially young TOIs to facilitate detailed transit and flare analyses in these systems.

However, since we cannot observe the processes of disk migration directly, we are left studying its byproducts, which includes the orbital architectures of systems where planets are found near or in resonance. To make further progress towards understanding these fundamental formation questions, we propose to study transit timing variations (TTVs) of planets in multi-planet systems near or in resonance using TESS Cycle 7 observations. These new measurements of TTVs will extend existing baselines on our targets, resulting in more precise orbital solutions and

Our approach involves the utilization of custom narrow-band filters attached to the Apache Point Observatory's 3.5m and 0.5m telescopes, and simultaneous Swift & NICER observations. Our aim is to create an unprecedented catalog of Balmer jump ratios and multi-color emission properties of TESS flares. We plan to investigate how these properties evolve during the flare time, and discuss the physical mechanisms that determine flare heating rates. Our study will enable us to more accurately estimate flare energy and provide a critical constraint for the flare emission effects on exoplanets.

The method is immune to data gaps and increases in sensitivity with the orbital period and is thus ideally suited for the 7-year timebase that will be enabled through TESS Cycle 7.

We propose 20-second and 2-minute cadence observations for a magnitude-limited (Tmag < 13) sample of stars with masses between 10%-30% the mass of the Sun, which will mitigate issues with pointing jitter in FFIs. We discuss that higher cadence observations of the brightest very-low-mass stars will add an additional 4-8 planets in Cycle 7, doubling the yield expected from FFI frames. This magnitude-limited sample, which was systematically built, will provide stronger constraints on the planet occurrence rate for the lowest-mass stars.

These bursts start as X-ray flares of durations typically of about 10-100 seconds, and the X-rays then heat the outer parts of the accretion disks, and part of the X-ray emission is reprocessed into the optical band. The recurrence time of the bursts is set by the time it takes to accrete a pile that heats up enough to trigger CNO burning, and understanding the recurrence time as a function of accretion rate yields key information about nuclear physics. TESS's continuous coverage and wide field are necessary to estimate the recurrence times, which have been hard-to-impossible to measure over the 50 years in which these bursts have been observed to date.

Detached EBs are the most effective tool to measure precise masses and radii of stars. Less than half of main sequence binaries with dynamical masses and radii have metallicity estimates, and there are even fewer metal poor targets. We identified 42 metal poor EB candidates by combining the ASAS-SN EB catalog with spectroscopic surveys and Gaia astrometry. We propose to use TESS light curves and ground-based radial velocities to dynamically measure the masses and radii of 30 systems. By doing so we can improve models for metal poor stars and empirical relations between stellar properties.

                        <div class="accordion-body">Stellar oscillations offer a unique window into the internal dynamics of stars and have become the gold-standard for calibrating fundamental stellar properties. These observations trace the time variation of either intensity (through photometry) or radial velocity (though spectroscopy), but almost never with both. However, simultaneously monitoring oscillations using both channels can significantly improve our understanding of stellar interiors and atmospheres, offering constraints that differ from those obtained through either method alone. Here we propose a pioneering set of simultaneous observations of stellar oscillations in solar-type stars to address this critical gap, using TESS and ground-based Extremely Precise Radial Velocity instruments.

We will combine asteroseismic parameters nu max and delta nu extracted from these images with luminosities, distances, and temperatures to obtain asteroseismic masses. Combined with metallicities obtained from gaia-xgboost and spectroscopic follow-up, these masses complete the set of constraints needed to calibrate isochrones. Such calibration systems are rare: this campaign will yield a 5-fold increase in the number of ``holy grail'' targets whose components share an age but have two different masses. We will use Cycle 7 s timely overlap with K2 fields to benchmark our method for 20 targets observed in both K2 and TESS Cycle 7.

Such dynamical processes can lead to the engulfment of planets by their host stars, which is thought to be a mechanism by which lithium (Li) may be enhanced in these stars. Such engulfment-induced Li enhancement signatures have the strength and longevity to be detectable. We propose to conduct a comprehensive Li abundance survey of subgiant and early red-giant-branch stars which are known to host closely-orbiting, eccentric planets using high-resolution ground-based spectroscopy. Our survey will serve to constrain the link between dynamical interactions in planetary systems and engulfment events.

The goal of this proposal is to maximize the TESS science return from analyses of Sco-Cen. We will do this by combining new Cycle 7 observations with archival data to create new light curves. Our interest is in finding young transiting exoplanets, so we will proceed by developing methods for detecting transiting planets in spot-dominated light curves, producing the highest quality light curves possible, and searching those light curves for real planets. Our light curves, planet-search software, and planet catalog will all be made available to the community.

Bright eclipsing binary (EB) systems are excellent test beds for stellar models, which must reproduce both stars' precisely measured physical properties at the same age and composition. We request TESS FFIs for 13 such EBs whose components are in different evolutionary stages (e.g. a dwarf and a giant) and thus provide stringent, HR-diagram-spanning tests. We will extract light curves from the FFIs; measure their masses, radii, and temperatures to high precision the eclipses, radial velocities, and spectral energy distributions; and compare to predicted values from several stellar models.

By comparing the spin-orbit alignments of warm Jupiters and Sub-Saturns, we seek to uncover the specific dynamical processes shaping their orbits. This endeavor is set to provide significant insights into the formation, evolution, and dynamic history of short-period gas giants, contributing to the broader question of our Solar System.

                        <div class="accordion-body">Convective boundary mixing (CBM) has far-reaching astrophysical consequences: it determines the lifetimes, final fates, physical properties, and population statistics of massive stars and compact objects, and governs the properties of standard candles like red clump stars. Despite this importance, it remains a major source of uncertainty in stellar modelling. Asteroseismology is our only means of probing its effects on stellar structure. Whereas existing asteroseismic investigations into CBM examine it above convective cores, we propose to use 200-second TESS full-frame images (FFIs) to probe CBM under convective envelopes, in late subgiants: a hitherto observationally inaccessible phase of evolution, and a physical regime in which it has so far been largely overlooked.

To remedy this, we developed a user-friendly pipeline for extracting deblended PRF and optimized aperture photometry from FFIs. The proposed work will publish v1.0 of our pipeline after minor development, and improve the current pipeline further with an implementation of a dynamic, fully analytical PRF model (v2.0). The hyper-parameters for the PRF model will be computed and made available within 2 weeks of each sector's data release in Cycle 7. By reducing the barrier to light curve extraction, this work will allow users to access systematics-corrected and deblended light curves as soon as seconds after calibrated FFI data becomes available.

This database calibrates astronomical images in the optical and infrared, including those taken by telescopes like Spitzer and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). TESS has already identified variability larger than 1% in a subset of these stars. These stars are necessary to accurately calibrate the absolute and relative flux across different instruments and observatories. By monitoring these targets with TESS, we will detect and constrain their variability, empowering observatories like JWST to efficiently choose stars that will produce the best possible spectrophotometric calibrations.

TESS has changed this by tripling the number of planets known transiting evolved stars. However, the vast majority of new discoveries have been high-SNR hot Jupiter systems, due to the relatively short TESS light curves available at first. Now, TESS Extended Mission data is making it possible to confirm longer-period and smaller-radius planets around evolved stars. Here, we propose to use the TESS Cycle 7 data to find additional transiting planet candidates around evolved stars that would otherwise be overlooked. We predict the detection of 5-10 new planet candidates, which will help resolve decades-old debates about planet inflation and migration at late evolutionary states.

To address this and help mitigate spot contamination in exoplanet transmission, we propose a study of rapidly rotating M Dwarfs observable both by TESS and ground-based facilities which we will use to understand the multi-color character of stellar rotation. The proposed study will yield measurements of spot temperature for a sample of stars which is representative of many of TESS' L1 transit hosts.

But there are exceptions, and it is these exception that provide us with important insights into the interactions of these close binary systems. The post novae V1280 Sco and V5856 Sgr are stuck some 7-9~mag brighter than their pre-outburst magnitudes. In this extended plateau the light curves feature dips during which the optical brightness drops by up to 1 mag. During these dips the spectra change from one dominated by cool lines to a hot spectrum with strong He II 4686 and Bowen N III lines, and forbidden [O III] and [Fe VII]. This suggests that the drop in continuum opacity is revealing the central ionizing source. We propose to use TESS and Swift, along with ground-based photometry and spectroscopy, to investigate these systems
