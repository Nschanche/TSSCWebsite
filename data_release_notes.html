        There is an oscillation in the background with a period of 1 day caused by the rotation of the Earth.<p></p>
       The Moon gets quite close to the FOV of Camera 1 at the end of the sector. On the last day of observations, the angle between the Moon and the boresight of Camera 1 is <30◦ , which causes a the large spike.<p></p>

        Mars was near opposition during Sector 1 and landed in the field-of-view of Camera 1 for ∼2 days at the beginning of observations. Specifically, it is in Camera 1, CCD 4, output channel D, and visual inspection of the FFIs and target pixel files shows an extremely bright object with excess charge spread across the pixels in this output channel.<p></p>
        As a consequence, photometry is unreliable in this section of the CCD in the first ∼510 cadences of the sector. See pgs. 7 and 8 of the DRN for more information.

      <td>Timing precision and accuracy</td>
      <td>
        Due to an error in the spacecraft clock kernel, the two-minute cadence durations vary by ∼0.51 msec and the FFI durations vary by ∼7.8 msec. The changes in the durations are discontinuous and occur at reference points used to interpolate the conversion from space- craft time to TJD. However, these errors are well within TESS’s 1 second timing accuracy requirement.

During these times, the ACS feedback loop was altered and the calibration parameters tuned.  The jitter profile during these times differs substantially from the normal data collection mode, which used the same ACS configuration as in Sectors 1 and 2. Imaging and light curve data during these tests is provided for completeness, but has limited use for scientific applications. Valid data in the standard ACS configuration were collected between TJD 1385.8966 and 1395.4800 in orbit 13 and between TJD 1396.6050 and 1406.2925 in orbit 14, spanning ∼20.4 days of useful observations.

No data or telemetry were collected during this period. After the instrument anomaly the heaters were turned on , increasing the camera temperature by ∼ 20◦ to approximately −67◦ C. Once the camera power was restored, the heaters were turned off and the camera temperatures returned to nominal within three days.

        Some channels show a small non-zero residual in the mean black level after calibration that is either static (e.g., camera 3, CCD 2, output D) or slowly time varying (e.g., camera 4, CCD 1, all outputs and camera 4, CCD 3, all outputs). The level of these residuals is minor i.e., ∼ 1e<sup>-3</sup> ADU/read and the timescale of variation is of order 5–10 days. These residuals are thought to be caused by the jitter of bright stars on the specific CCD slices, and therefore it is a persistent effect in the rest of the sectors. The impact of these residuals on scientific output is likely negligible. However, the Sector 7 data were calibrated using the updated 1-D black method, from which we do not expect such time-varying residuals.

        At TJD 1531.74, an interruption in communications between the instrument and spacecraft occurred, resulting in an instrument turn-off until TJD 1535.00. No data or telemetry were collected during this period. After the instrument anomaly the heaters were turned on, increasing the camera temperature by ∼ 20◦ to approximately −67◦ C. Once the camera power was restored, the heaters were turned off and the camera temperatures returned to nominal within three days. The temperature increase caused changes in the camera focal plane scale and mean black levels of individual CCD channels. The mean black levels are calibrated out in the SPOC pipeline. Changes in focal plane temperature cause changes in the raw photometry, but the PDC systematic error-correction algorithm removes this effect for most targets.

</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> In sector 10, a new linearity model is used in pixel calibration. The differences between new and old linearity model are quite small over the majority of the dynamic range of the CCDs, rising to ∼ 1 − 2% near pixel saturation. This new linearity model will be applied to all sector data from Sector 10 on, and it will be applied to data from Sectors 1-9 when those data are reprocessed.</p>

        Due to scattered light from the Earth  Camera 1 was disabled and Camera 4 alone was used for guiding in all of orbit 31. This configuration causes the apparent pointing of Cameras 1, 2 and 3 to drift by larger amounts than in other sectors due to differential velocity aberration. The amplitude of the drift depends on each camera, and has a maximum value of 3 arc-seconds (0.14 pixels) in Camera 1 from the beginning to end of orbit 31. In orbit 32, both Camera 1 and Camera 4 were used for guiding for the entire duration of the orbit.

        This is the first sector of the northern ecliptic hemisphere survey. For northern pointings, scattered light from the Earth and Moon is a more persistent issue for Camera 1 and Camera 2 than for southern pointings. For this reason, the spacecraft pointing was set at +85 degrees in ecliptic latitude, so that Camera 2 and Camera 3 straddle the ecliptic pole<p></p>
       Camera 1 still suffers from strong scattered light signals, and so guiding was disabled in Camera 1 for both orbits 35 and 36. Camera 4 alone was used for guiding in all of orbits 35 and 36.

        In Sector 14, the Earth is above the sunshade for almost the entire sector, and the backgrounds are somewhat higher for longer periods of time than in other sectors. The 24 hour rotation period of the Earth and several harmonics thereof are also visible as oscillations in the background for most of both orbits. Finally, the Earth passes close to Camera 1 towards the last quarter of each orbit and saturates the detectors—these times were excluded with CCD-specific “Scattered Light” flags.

</p>
<p><b>Update: </b></p>
<p>The FFI timestamps for Sector 18 are incorrect.  The readouts of the four cameras are staggered by 0.5 seconds in the following order: Camera 1 (0 second offset), Camera 3 (0.5 second offset), Camera 4 (1.0 second offset), and Camera 2 (1.5 second offset). Although these offsets are correctly incorporated into the timestamps in the target pixel files and light curves, the FFI time stamps are not corrected for the staggered readout. For Sector 1 through Sector 18, the offsets for each camera can be added to the TSTART and TSTOP header values in the FFIs to correct the issue.</p>
<p>In addition, the TSTOP header values in the target pixel files, light curve files, and FFIs are overestimated by 20 ms, and the TIME column of the target pixel files and light curve files are overestimated by 10 ms.</p>

  Warning for Sector 20: The FFI timestamps have been adjusted by ~0.5 seconds due to staggered readouts.
The assigned timestamps of the previously released data products are too large by 2 seconds, the Sector 20 data products have been updated and have accurate timestamps.
The photometric apertures for targets with Tmag less than 11 were slightly increased. This change most noticeably affects the light curves of saturated stars, which had higher flux losses during periods of increased pointing jitter using the smaller apertures

</p>
<p><b>Updates:</b></p>
<li>In Sector 20, the the FFI timestamps have been adjusted for the 0.5 second staggered readouts of the four cameras and the 0.02 second staggered readouts for individual CCDs within a camera.</li>
<li>The assigned timestamps of the previously released data products are too large by 2 seconds. The issue was caused by an off-by-one error in ground system software that identifies the timestamps of individual two second exposures. The Sector 20 data products have been updated and have accurate timestamps</li>
<li>The start times of integrations for every 2 minute and 30 minute cadence were shifted forward by 31 milliseconds, and the end times were shifted forward by 11 milliseconds. These offsets correct for effects in the focal plane electronics that were not accounted for in previous data releases.</li>
<li>Until sectors 1-19 are re-processed, the adjustments mentioned above should be applied to the FFI image headers. </li>
<li>Two-minute data products report the TJD at mid-exposure, and so should be corrected by adding 21 milliseconds to the timestamps.</li>
<li>Note that the correction only applies to the timestamps themselves.</li>
<li>In Sector 20, the photometric apertures for targets with Tmag < 11 were slightly increased. This change most noticeably affects the light curves of saturated stars, which had higher flux losses during periods of increased pointing jitter using the smaller apertures.</li>

  Warning for Sector 27 (September 2020): This is the first data release for the extended mission. Key changes have occurred including the collection of 10-min FFI data instead of 30-min, and 20-second target pixel files.
<ul>
<li>The background correction was updated for the extended mission, with the new method providing improved results for fainter and crowded stars.</li>
<li>For targets observed in both Year 1 and Year 3, Year 3 processing was done using TIC 8.1 while TIC 7 was used for Year 1 processing; this may result in differences in results for certain targets.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p><b>Updates: </b></p>
<p><b>This is the first data release for the extended mission</b></p>
<li>FFI data is collected every 10 min, rather than 30.</li>
<li>Selected pixel stamps are collected at a 20-sec cadence.</li>
<li>Data products for the 20 second mode have the keyword "fast" in the file names.</li>
<li>For 20-second data, only target pixel files, light curve files, collateral pixel files, and co-trending basis vectors (CBVs) were produced.</li>
<li>As usual cosmic rays were mitigated in the 2-minute cadence data and 10-minute FFIs by an algorithm running on the instrument firmware - see DRN pg. 8, for more info. Note however, that in the new 20-second pixel data cosmic rays were identified and removed in the pipeline, and that they can be restored in the pixel data and light curves if necessary.</li>
<li>The background correction employed throughout the primary mission was updated for the extended mission. The new method provides improved results for fainter and crowded stars. The correction is applied only to 2-min and 20-sec data. A full explanation of this correction is on pg. 10 of the DRN</li>
<li>For targets observed in both Year 1 and Year 3, Year 3 processing was done using TIC 8.1 while TIC 7 was used for Year 1 processing; this may result in different results for certain targets. Differences for some crowded and/or dim targets may also result from the background correction algorithm update (see below). Reprocessing of Year 1 data with TIC 8.1 and the latest codebase is underway at the SPOC, as of Fall 2020. </li>
<li>The algorithm in the CAL module that propagates uncertainty from the 2D bias model was changed. This uncertainty is a static term and is no longer applied to the pixel data or subsequent processing in the pipeline.</li>
<li>The algorithm in the PA module that estimates the sky background was changed.  A scalar offset is now applied that forces the dimmest background-corrected pixels to values near zero, if those pixels were significantly negative.</li>

        Year 3 is a re-observation of the southern ecliptic hemisphere, which will take place over 13 sectors. The pointing strategy is the same as for Year 1, except the locations of Sectors 27–39 are offset in ecliptic longitude with respect to Sectors 1–13. All sectors in Year 3 are planned for a spacecraft pointing of −54 degrees in ecliptic latitude.

<p><b>Updates:</b></p>
<li>As of Sector 30, co-trending basis vector (CBV) files only include the first eight principal components for the Single Scale co-trending mode.</li>
<li>As a reminder, the pipeline only uses the first eight CBVs for co-trending, because subsequent CBVs are usually dominated by stochastic noise. When using CBVs beyond 8, users should check for excess noise being introduced into the detrended light curve</li>
<li>In Sectors 30–33, the values for CBVs 9–16 are set to 0.</li>

        Sector 41 consists of observations of the northern ecliptic hemisphere. For northern pointings, scattered light from the Earth and Moon is a more persistent issue for Camera 1 and Camera 2 than for southern pointings. For this reason, the spacecraft pointing was set at +85 degrees in ecliptic latitude, so that Camera 2 and Camera 3 straddle the ecliptic pole. Both Cameras 1 and 4 were used for guiding in orbits 89 and 90 of Sector 41.

It does not affect contrending for any targets on this CCD, although the smear correction for its associated columns is unreliable and targets close to Jupiter may have unreliable photometry for the first 7 days of observations.

The change starts at TJD=2475.22927 in orbit 93, and is restricted to orbit 93. The amplitude is very small, only 0.27 electrons per second, and is usually corrected at the flux time series level during background subtraction for individual targets. However, the effect is not removed by the calibration model and is visible in raw/calibrated pixels in this region of the detector. See the DRN for more information.

        Sector 46 consists of observations of the ecliptic plane, with the camera array aligned along the ecliptic and Camera 1 the westernmost of the four. Within the first 13 hours of orbit 99, Camera 4 alone was used for guiding. However, the Earth passed close enough to Camera 4 after this time that guiding was switched to Camera 1. The change in guiding was done in two steps. First, Camera 1 was enabled for guiding (concurrently with Camera 4) at TJD= 2552.088254 days. Then, Camera 4 was disabled for guiding 30 minutes later, at TJD= 2552.109087 days. At these two epochs, the spacecraft pointing shifted by a small amount, less than 1". The cadences for each data mode at these epochs are marked with an Attitude Tweak anomaly flag. In some cases, especially for saturated stars, the SAP FLUX light curves exhibit a step function at these times. Camera 1 alone was used for guiding in all of orbit 100.

<p><b>Update: </b>DR80 is the first data release of the second TESS extended mission, in which the FFI data collection interval has been reduced to 200 seconds. As in the primary mission and first extended mission, select pixel stamps were collected at 2-minute cadence and 20-second cadence. The number of targets in each data mode were adjusted: 13,000 targets were selected for 2-minute cadence observations, while all observable 20-second cadence targets were selected.</p>

              The pointing in Sector 56 was set at +55.5<sup>◦</sup> in ecliptic latitude. As a result, Camera 4 was pointed near, but not exactly at the North Ecliptic Pole. The slight offset in target declination was introduced in the second Extended Mission to allow observations of the North Ecliptic Pole itself, which has fallen in the gaps between CCDs in the Prime Mission and first Extended Mission. Camera 1 and Camera 4 were used for guiding in both orbit 119 and 120, except for the
              second half of orbit 119 in which Camera 4 alone was used for guiding.

However, there is no data during this time and values in the target pixel files and light curves

The spacecraft dropped into coarse pointing during this configuration change, and settles into fine pointing over the next 40 seconds.

            temperature change. After a commanded instrument reset, data collection resumed at the nominal
            operating conditions with no lasting impact due to the anomaly. The anomaly did not affect

            <p>Camera 4, CCD 4 FFI data during this time is not available on the MAST archive. FFI
              data for all other Cameras and CCDs were not impacted by the anomaly and are available on

        At the beginning of the first orbit TESS performed engineering tests lasting ∼2 days.
Five intervals during this time (lasting a total of ∼ 6.3 hr) where the spacecraft pointing was
subject to impulses have the Manual Exclude (bit 8) data quality flag set in the 2-min and
20-sec data products. Data with Manual Exclude data quality flag are excluded for analysis
in PDC, TPS, and DV. The FFI data products have the Manual Exclude data quality flag
set during the entire duration of the 2 day engineering test because the FFIs were processed
before the impact of the spacecraft pointing behavior was analyzed. Users can recover valid
FFI data in the intervals given in Table 1 of <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/tess/doc/tess_drn/tess_sector_69_drn96_v01.pdf"> DRN 96</a>, which are consistent with the periods of good

      <td>
        Jupiter enters the field of view of Camera 1 CCD 4 midway through orbit 149a (TJD ∼3237.82; Cadence Number 1447460). Jupiter’s appearance on the detector severely contaminates the trailing/leading black and smear calibration regions for the slice A readout columns (Columns 45 – 556), and the calibration of slice A is compromised for the entire sector. As a result of Jupiter’s light spilling into the calibration regions, the trailing/leading black levels fit along detector rows and the smear estimate fit along detector columns exhibit strong spatial gradients. Targets and FFI data on the Camera 1 CCD 4 slice A readout region are not correctly calibrated. The remaining readout slice B, C, D (columns 557 – 2092) regions for Camera 1 CCD 4 are not impacted by the calibration issues due to Jupiter. Data quality flags in the target and FFI data products for this region do not indicate when the calibration is compromised on slice A. Targets on this slice have unreliable photometry.

        Offnominal data downlink contacts resulted in the instrument solid state recorder (SSR) filling to capacity. Once the SSR reaches capacity, old data is maintained and new data is not recorded. Due to SSR fill, 2.16 days of observations at the end of 154a were not recorded.
