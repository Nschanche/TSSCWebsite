			Beginning 2023-06-28 17:44 UTC (3124.224 TJD) until the end of the sector (2.2 day duration), TESS performed engineering tests. Pointing performance was highly variable during the engineering tests. Data during the engineering test is available on MAST archive. The Manual Exclude data quality flag (bit 8) is set in the FFI, 2-min, and 20-sec data products during the engineering test. Data during the engineering test was excluded for analysis in PDC, TPS, and DV.

		<td>Fine Pointing mode issue</td>
		<td>
			At 2023-06-27 14:28 UTC (3123.105 TJD), for 1 minute, the spacecraft dropped out of Fine Pointing mode, and the spacecraft subsequently self-recovered back into Fine Pointing mode. Data continued to be collected while in Coarse Pointing: these data are flagged and removed from the PDCSAP FLUX light curves and transiting planet search. The FFIs are also flagged for Coarse Pointing.

			The pointing in Sector 66 was set at âˆ’55.5 degrees in ecliptic latitude. Camera 1 and Camera 4 were both used for guiding in Orbit 139a and 140a, while Camera 4 alone was used for guiding in Orbit 139b and 140b.  Pointing performance during the engineering testing (>3124.2 TJD) is highly variable, and the PDC, TPS, and DV modules ignored data beyond this timestamp; the manual exclude data quality flag (bit 8) also identifies data impacted by the engineering test.
