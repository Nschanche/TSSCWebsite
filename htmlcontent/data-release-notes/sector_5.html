   Warning for Sector 5: The SPOC pipeline 1-D Black correction has been changed to a two-component model from the polynomial fit that had been used prior. The two components include: a time-varying correction and a static row-by- row correction.

  <b>Update:</b> Starting with Sector 5 processing, the SPOC pipeline 1-D Black correction has been changed to a two-component model from the polynomial fit that had been used prior. The two components include: a time-varying correction and a static row-by- row correction. To learn more about this see pg. 8 and 9 of the DRN.

      <td>The use of Camera 1 in attitude control was disabled for the last ∼ 0.5 days of orbit 18 (2018-12-11 UTC, cadence #170269) due to strong scattered light signals, and data taken with Camera 1 during this period were excluded from the pipeline analysis.

      <td>At the end of orbit 18, the Earth was < 35◦ from the boresight of Camera 1. At these low angles, the level of scattered light is too high for meaningful guide star centroids to be measured - see Guiding issue above. Disabling Camera 1 guiding near the end of the Sector caused a brief impulse in pointing, which settled out within minutes.

      <td>Scattered light</td>
      <td>In Sector 5, the main stray light features are caused by the Earth rising above the sunshade at the end of each orbit, and strong glints appear during these times. The Earth moves quite close to the boresight of Camera 1 at the end of orbit 18.</td>

      <td>TJD Calculation</td>
      <td>The clock kernel used to calculate TJD in Sector 5 used ranging data collected only through late August, 2018; as a result, the extrapolation to Sector 5 times is slightly off. The error between true and calculated times grew linearly with time since August 2018, so that the calculated TJD values in all data products are offset from the correct values by ∼1.7 seconds at the end of orbit 18 (2018-12-11 UTC).

  During TESS’s primary mission several updates were made to various instrument models, algorithms, and pipeline parameters. Below we list what was updated and applied when reprocessing sectors 1-13. Please see <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/tess/doc/tess_drn/tess_reprocessing-sector_1_13_drn42_v02.pdf">DRN42</a> for a more comprehensive explanation of each update.
