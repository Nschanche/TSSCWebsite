        The use of Camera 1 in attitude control was disabled at the start of both orbits due to strong scattered light signals. Camera 1 guiding was enabled in orbit 29 on 2019-04-26 UTC (Cadence # 268190), and orbit 30 on 2019-05-10 UTC (Cadence # 278455).

    <tr>
      <td>Space Craft Pointing</td>
      <td>
        At the start of each orbit, the Earth was close to the boresight of Camera 1, and the level of scattered light was too high for meaningful guide star centroids to be measured. Guiding with Camera 1 was therefore disabled at these times, and attitude control was done using only inputs from Camera 4. When Camera 1 guiding was re-enabled, the spacecraft attitude shifted by a small amount, about 1 arc-second (0.05 pixels).

<p>
  During TESS’s primary mission several updates were made to various instrument models, algorithms, and pipeline parameters. Below we list what was updated and applied when reprocessing sectors 1-13. Please see <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/tess/doc/tess_drn/tess_reprocessing-sector_1_13_drn42_v02.pdf">DRN42</a> for a more comprehensive explanation of each update.
