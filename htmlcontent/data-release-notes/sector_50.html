        Data collection was paused for four hours in orbit 107 (between TJD 2672.2512 and 2672.4206) to test data downlink near spacecraft apogee, in preparation for operation changes scheduled for 2022 September.

        Sector 50 consists of observations of the northern ecliptic hemisphere, with Camera 4 pointed near the north ecliptic pole. Camera 4 alone was used for guiding in the first half of orbit 107. After the data downlink at apogee, guiding with both Cameras 1 and 4 was enabled. This introduced a small shift in the spacecraft attitude in the second half of orbit 107. Some SAP FLUX light curves may show discontinuities before and after the data gap at these times. However, cotrending with PDC removes this offset in most cases. Camera 4 alone was used for guiding in all of orbit 108.

      <td>Scattered light</td>
      <td>
        At the start of orbit 107, the Earth crosses through Cameras 1 and 2, saturating the CCD detectors and/or causing strong glints. At the start of orbit 108, the Earth and then the Moon moves through Camera 1, saturating the detectors and causing strong glints and scattered light signals in both Cameras 1 and 2.
