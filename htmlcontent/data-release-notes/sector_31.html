        At UTC 2020-11-16 10:37, there was a star tracker anomaly which led to the instrument being turned off. As a result, the data collection period in orbit 70 ended 2.08 days earlier than scheduled. The cameras were turned on and returned to normal operations on 2020-11-20, at the beginning of Sector 32.

        Camera 1 suffered from strong scattered light signals at the end of orbit 69 and orbit 70, and so Camera 4 alone was used for guiding during this sector.
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td>Scattered light</td>
      <td>
        In Sector 31, the Moon introduces a strong glint in Camera 1 at the end of orbit 69, followed by scattered light signals in all cameras caused by the Earth. Due to the star tracker anomaly, no data were taken during periods of high scattered light in orbit 70.
