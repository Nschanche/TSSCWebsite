        At TJD 2949.99, the spacecraft entered into safe mode, resulting in instrument turn-off
until TJD 2955.04. There are no FFIs, target pixel file data, or light curve data during this
time. During these times (as well as when the spacecraft is transmitting data to ground
systems) the data and timestamps in target-pixel files and light curve files are set to NULL.
One FFI from Camera 1 in orbit 127 was corrupted prior to downlink from the spacecraft
and could not be recovered. The FFIINDEX number is 00738895 (timestamp 2022358084201),
and no FFI file for Camera 1 was produced for this cadence.

        The pointing in Sector 60 was set at +55.5 degrees in ecliptic latitude. Camera 4 alone
was used for guiding in the first half of orbit 127. Camera 1 and Camera 4 were both used for guiding at all other times.
