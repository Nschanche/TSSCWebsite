        Sector 42 consists of observations of the ecliptic plane. For ecliptic pointings, the antisolar point is set towards the edge of Camera 1 (nearest Camera 2), and Cameras 2, 3, and 4 are aligned parallel to the ecliptic plane in the westward direction. Camera 4 alone was used for guiding in orbits 91 and 92 of Sector 42.

      <td>Scattered light</td>
      <td>
        In Orbit 91, the Moon crosses the fields of view of all cameras (one at a time), and the Earth crosses the fields of view of Cameras 1 and 2. The Moon and the Earth saturate CCD detectors during these times. Outside of these times, strong scattered light signals are also present for most of Orbit 91 and the second half of Orbit 92.

      <td>Jupiter</td>
      <td>
        Jupiter was near opposition during Sector 42, and landed in the field-of-view of Camera 1 for âˆ¼7 days at the beginning of observations. Jupiter appears as a very bright object at the bottom of Camera 1, CCD 4, output channel A. It does not affect contrending for any targets on this CCD, although the smear correction for its associated columns is unreliable and targets close to Jupiter may have unreliable photometry for the first 7 days of observations.
