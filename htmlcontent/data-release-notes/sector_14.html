  Warning for Sector 14: Sector 14 is the first northern ecliptic hemisphere pointing. It uses an updated SPOC pipeline and makes use of CCD-specific anomaly flags.
This sector uses TIC 8, which is based on Gaia DR2 astrometry and photometry, and uses Gaia DR2 parallaxes to inform stellar parameters.

<p><b>Updates: </b></p>
<li>Sector 14 is the first northern ecliptic hemisphere pointing.</li>
<li>This is first sector to make use of TIC 8, which is based on Gaia DR2 astrometry and photometry, and uses Gaia DR2 parallaxes to inform stellar parameters details are provided by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....158..138S/abstract">Stassun et al (2019)</a> and the <a href="https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/TESS/TIC+v8+and+CTL+v8.xx+Data+Release+Notes">TIC release notes</a>.</li>
<li>The spacecraft is pointed to a higher ecliptic latitude (+85 degrees rather than +54 degrees) to mitigate issues with scattered light in Camera 1 and Camera 2.</li>
<li>Sector 14 processing is the first to make use of an updated SPOC data processing pipeline, SPOC Release 4.0 </li>
<li>It is the first to make use of CCD-specific Data Anomaly Flags that mark cadences excluded due to high levels of scattered light. The flags are referred to as “Scattered Light” flags and marked with bit 13, value 4096 - see section 2 of the DRN.</li>
<li>The algorithm in the TPS module for searching for transiting planets was changed.  An initial run of TPS is now used to identify problematic epochs that are assigned ”deemphasis weights” in the final run of TPS.</li>

        This is the first sector of the northern ecliptic hemisphere survey. For northern pointings, scattered light from the Earth and Moon is a more persistent issue for Camera 1 and Camera 2 than for southern pointings. For this reason, the spacecraft pointing was set at +85 degrees in ecliptic latitude, so that Camera 2 and Camera 3 straddle the ecliptic pole<p></p>
	   Camera 1 still suffers from strong scattered light signals, and so guiding was disabled in Camera 1 for both orbits 35 and 36. Camera 4 alone was used for guiding in all of orbits 35 and 36.

        In Sector 14, the Earth is above the sunshade for almost the entire sector, and the backgrounds are somewhat higher for longer periods of time than in other sectors. The 24 hour rotation period of the Earth and several harmonics thereof are also visible as oscillations in the background for most of both orbits. Finally, the Earth passes close to Camera 1 towards the last quarter of each orbit and saturates the detectors—these times were excluded with CCD-specific “Scattered Light” flags.

    The data products of sectors 14 to 19 were generated using version 4.0 of the science processing pipeline and conform to the final set of data anomaly flags.

	   - Cadences with insufficient targets to derive cotrending basis vectors are flagged and the PDCSAP FLUX light curves are set to NULL at these times<p></p>
