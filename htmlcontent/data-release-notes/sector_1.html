      <td>Scattered light</td>
      <td>
        In Sector 1, the main stray light features to be aware of are:<p></p>
        There is an oscillation in the background with a period of 1 day caused by the rotation of the Earth.<p></p>
       The Moon gets quite close to the FOV of Camera 1 at the end of the sector. On the last day of observations, the angle between the Moon and the boresight of Camera 1 is <30◦ , which causes a the large spike.<p></p>
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td>Mars</td>
      <td>
        Mars was near opposition during Sector 1 and landed in the field-of-view of Camera 1 for ∼2 days at the beginning of observations. Specifically, it is in Camera 1, CCD 4, output channel D, and visual inspection of the FFIs and target pixel files shows an extremely bright object with excess charge spread across the pixels in this output channel.<p></p>
        As a consequence, photometry is unreliable in this section of the CCD in the first ∼510 cadences of the sector. See pgs. 7 and 8 of the DRN for more information.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Timing precision and accuracy</td>
      <td>
        Due to an error in the spacecraft clock kernel, the two-minute cadence durations vary by ∼0.51 msec and the FFI durations vary by ∼7.8 msec. The changes in the durations are discontinuous and occur at reference points used to interpolate the conversion from space- craft time to TJD. However, these errors are well within TESS’s 1 second timing accuracy requirement.

  During TESS’s primary mission several updates were made to various instrument models, algorithms, and pipeline parameters. Below we list what was updated and applied when reprocessing sectors 1-13. Please see <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/tess/doc/tess_drn/tess_reprocessing-sector_1_13_drn42_v02.pdf">DRN42</a> for a more comprehensive explanation of each update.
