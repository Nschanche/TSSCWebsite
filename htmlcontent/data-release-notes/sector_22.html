  Warning for Sector 22: Four FFI cadences and two 2-minute cadences were lost due to computer issues.
A ~2 second error in data product timestamps has been corrected for starting with Sector 22. Previous data products will be corrected as they are reprocessed.

<h1>Sector 22 Information</h1>
<p>For full data release notes see: <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/tess/doc/tess_drn/tess_sector_22_drn31_v02.pdf">DRN31</a>. For a list of TIC IDs with noted issues, see this <a href="sector_22.html">list</a>.</p>
<p><b>Updates:</b></p>
<li>The reported times for previous data products are too large by 2 seconds. This issue has been fixed for Sector 22 data products, which have updated and accurate timestamps.</li>
<li>Timestamps from previous sectors can be corrected by subtracting 2 seconds. Future data releases will include reprocessed data with corrected timestamps.</li>
<li>The start times of integrations for every 2 minute and 30 minute cadence have been shifted forward by 31 milliseconds, and the end times have been shifted forward by 11 milliseconds.</li>
<li>These offsets correct for effects in the focal plane electronics that were not accounted for in previous data releases. Until data is re-processed the times must be adjusted by adding correct values to headers.</li>
<li>Two-minute data products report the TJD at mid-exposure, and so should be corrected by adding 21 milliseconds to the timestamps.</li>
<li>Note that the correction only applies to the timestamps themselves; the reported exposure times in data product headers and flux values (electrons per second) are correct.</li>
