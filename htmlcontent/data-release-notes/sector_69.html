        At the beginning of the first orbit TESS performed engineering tests lasting ∼2 days.
Five intervals during this time (lasting a total of ∼ 6.3 hr) where the spacecraft pointing was
subject to impulses have the Manual Exclude (bit 8) data quality flag set in the 2-min and
20-sec data products. Data with Manual Exclude data quality flag are excluded for analysis
in PDC, TPS, and DV. The FFI data products have the Manual Exclude data quality flag
set during the entire duration of the 2 day engineering test because the FFIs were processed
before the impact of the spacecraft pointing behavior was analyzed. Users can recover valid
FFI data in the intervals given in Table 1 of <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/tess/doc/tess_drn/tess_sector_69_drn96_v01.pdf"> DRN 96</a>, which are consistent with the periods of good
data in the 2-min and 20-sec data products.

      <td>Data gap:</td>
      <td>
        After the 2 day engineering test, data collection was paused for 36 min in order to
reconfigure the spacecraft for normal operations. During the reconfiguration duration, no
data quality flags are set; however, there are no data collected during this time. Values in
the target pixel files and light curves are set to NULL during the reconfiguration.

        One FFI from Cameras 1 and 2 in orbit 145 was corrupted prior to downlink from the
spacecraft and could not be recovered. The FFIINDEX number is 00849522, and no FFI
file for Camera 1 and 2 was produced for this cadence. One FFI from Camera 1 in orbit
146 was corrupted prior to downlink from the spacecraft and could not be recovered. The
FFIINDEX number is 00855522, and no FFI file for Camera 1 was produced for this cadence.

        The pointing in Sector 69 was set at −55.5 degrees in ecliptic latitude. During the 2 day
engineering test, all cameras were used for guiding. After observations resumed, Camera 1
and Camera 4 were both used for guiding in Orbit 145a and 146a, while Camera 4 alone
    was used for guiding in Orbit 145b and 146b.
