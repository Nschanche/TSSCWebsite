  Warning for Sector 13: There is a star tracker anomaly that causes the spacecraft to fall out of fine pointing for approximately 1.25 hours from TJD 1665.2983 to 1665.350. During this time, the spacecraft exhibited increased pointing jitter.

        There was a single upset in the  star trackers on the spacecraft bus. This resulted in a complicated interaction between the instrument quaternions and attitude control system. This interaction caused the spacecraft to fall out of fine pointing for approximately 1.25 hours from TJD 1665.2983 to 1665.350. During this time, the spacecraft exhibited increased pointing jitter - see page 3 of the DRN for more information.

        Due to the proximity of the Moon to the boresight of Camera 1, guiding with Camera 1 was disabled and Camera 4 alone was used for guiding in all of orbit 33. In Orbit 34, both Camera 1 and Camera 4 were used for guiding for the entire duration of the orbit.

  During TESS’s primary mission several updates were made to various instrument models, algorithms, and pipeline parameters. Below we list what was updated and applied when reprocessing sectors 1-13. Please see <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/tess/doc/tess_drn/tess_reprocessing-sector_1_13_drn42_v02.pdf">DRN42</a> for a more comprehensive explanation of each update.
