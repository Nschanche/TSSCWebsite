        Sector 43 consists of observations of the ecliptic plane. For ecliptic pointings, the antisolar point is set towards the edge of Camera 1 (nearest Camera 2), and Cameras 2, 3, and 4 are aligned parallel to the ecliptic plane in the westward direction. Camera 4 alone was used for guiding in orbits 93 and 94 of Sector 43. Outside of these times, strong scattered light signals are present when the Moon or Earth are near the camera fields of view.

        In Orbit 93, the Moon crosses the fields of view of all cameras (one at a time). The Moon saturates CCD detectors during these times. Outside of these times, strong scattered light signals are present when the Moon or Earth are near the camera fields of view.

      <td>Anomalous effects</td>
      <td>
        On Camera 3, CCD 1, ouput Channel D (columns greater than 1580), a small change to the start of frame ringing (cf. TESS Instrument Handbook, Section 6.8.2) was observed at row numbers â‰²750. The change starts at TJD=2475.22927 in orbit 93, and is restricted to orbit 93. The amplitude is very small, only 0.27 electrons per second, and is usually corrected at the flux time series level during background subtraction for individual targets. However, the effect is not removed by the calibration model and is visible in raw/calibrated pixels in this region of the detector. See the DRN for more information.
